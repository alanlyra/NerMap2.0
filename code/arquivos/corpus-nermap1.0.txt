Additionally, the present study adopted (b) rather than (a) in the sense that those individuals participating in the retrospective treatment experienced a potential future standpoint of generations 30 years from now.;S
In the energy transition, the use of stories and visions are common, for example the long-term goal of the EU to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels and the Energy roadmap 2050, which explores different ways to reach these reduction targets.;S
By 2050, the North Korean economy has greatly benefited with active inter-Korean economic cooperation, trade with China and Russia, and additional private investment coming from Japan and the U.S.;S
By 2050, while many Asian countries are suffering from food shortages, North Korea maintains a poor but stable economy through its own food self-sufficiency.;S
As of 2050, North Korea is receiving keen attention from ecologists who dream of a de-material and a de-oil civilization.;S
Thereafter, the emerging elite group of North Korea accelerates its transition to a capitalist market economy, and by 2050 North Korea becomes a leading country and a role model for the 4th industrial revolution.;S
The increase in private sector activities and investment from abroad lead to an increase in employment and the stabilization of people's livelihoods, with annual growth of more than 6 to 7 percent for nearly three decades.;S
Furthermore, with increasing public concerns about climate change and demands on governments to be responsive to the UN’s Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Knowledge Platform, n.d.), certain forms of materials development reliant on non-renewable materials may likely be subject to new environmental restrictions which limit the type or composition of materials that can be used within construction of school buildings, restricting opportunities for integrating smart materials and or systems in the aforementioned open learning spaces.;S
According to Bostrom (2015) 50 percent of the top AI researchers predict that AI will reach the level of general (or strong) intelligence by the year 2050 and 90 percent predict that general AI will be reached by 2070.;S
As it is expected that half the global population will live within 100 km of the coast by 2030 and the global number of flooding events is increasing, these numbers will increase even further in the next decades.;S
The International Energy Agency estimates that energy from renewable sources will reach a share of over 25% in the USA, 30% in Japan and China and even 50% in the European Union by 2040.;S
Along with the direct need of a growing population for heat, electricity and fuel, global energy demand is further increasing due to the mentioned developments affecting food and mineral resources. Energy has always been and will continue to be a key enabler of and also a requirement for economic growth. Global energy use is estimated to increase by one third from 2015 to 2040.;S
Although the annual population growth rate is expected to decrease slightly throughout the course of the century, the medium population estimate for 2050 and 2100 are 9.8 and 11.2 billion respectively.;S
As the demand for any good, be it food, energy, space and also services such as healthcare, scales with the number of existing consumers, the growing global population is the main driver of most large scale future developments. In addition to this explosive population growth, global urbanization rates are also drastically increasing (from 55% in 2018 to 68% by 2050).;S
With increases in global demand for crops ranging from 70% to 100% from the year 2005 until 2050, an increase in global production volumes is unavoidable. With declining growth rates of global agricultural efficiency, a significant part of this increase will need to come from expansion of agricultural areas.;S
As salmon farming has become a very important industry for the Norwegian economy with a total production of 1.2 Mt in 2014, the government is attempting to realize the high growth scenario of increasing the countries salmon production to around 5 Mt by 2050.;S
To compensate for this reduction in available land and still meet the increasing demand for food, an annual productivity growth of 2–2.4% would be required over the next 38 years (De Graaf, 2012). However, as already mentioned, the growth rate of global cereal production yield has been declining over the past.;S
According to the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish energy system cannot contribute with more than 10 Mton CO2(e) annually by 2050, for Sweden to contribute its share to meeting the 1.5° target of the Paris agreement (Energimyndigheten, 2016b: 123), a target that is only met by Legato and Vivace.;S
The consumption based emissions in the 2050 Legato scenario can thus be estimated to be 7 Mton annually, which is still below the limits of the 1.5° target, while Vivace 2050 ends up in 15 Mton, which is well above what emissions can be allowed.;S
In 2050 the Swedish population is estimated to have increased to 11.3 million people compared to 9.7 million people in 2014.;S
In this understanding, social innovation is just another means for fuelling smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the overall EU policy goal for 2020.;S
Positioning our research in the nexus of the theoretical concepts of sustainability transition and public deliberation, we present an empirical analysis of 179 citizen visions of sustainable and desirable futures extending to the year 2050 in 30 European countries.;S
The visions extended to the year 2050 to ensure distanciation from current everyday life and included concrete examples of what the vision would mean in practical terms for the citizens.;S
The finalised vision is a narrative storyline of a desirable and sustainable future in 2050 regardless of whether or not it is feasible from today’s point of view, while also describing how the vision differs from the present day.;S
In 2050 it is possible to use cellular therapies to reconstruct organs.;S
Some have made predictions up to a few years, some to the mid-2030s (PwC., 2017 Chang & Huynh, 2016), up to 2055 (McKinsey Global Institute, 2017) and even 2140 (Graeber, 2018). Third, they to a greater or lesser extent offer policy advice, advocating solutions to cope with or contain automation’s effects such as a lower minimum wage, skills-upgrading, generating automation-resistant employment, the so-called ‘robot tax’, or universal basic income scheme.;S
These are undoubtedly framing the public debate and reinforcing anxiety about technological unemployment: two recent surveys by Pew Research Centre have found that significantly more Americans are worried about automation’s impact than they are optimistic, and that in both advanced and emerging economies, most respondents expect that in the next 50 years robots and computers will take over many jobs currently performed by humans.;S
The four targets that all scenarios strive to achieve by 2050. Regarding resource security, the target focuses on financial resources, or resources that can replace financial resources, such as trading of goods. The fairness principles mentioned can play out differently in different scenarios.;S
All scenarios explore different strategies for achieving the four targets. All scenarios assume a population of 13 million in Sweden by 2050, which can be compared with 10 million in 2017.;S
Responsive higher education through transformational practices – The case of a Hungarian business school.;S
Specifically, from 2015 and the replacement of the UN Millennium Development Goals by the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to be achieved by 2030, the Principles are intended to support management educators in relation to their contribution to the SDGs (for a summary of PRME’s first decade and observations on the next decade).;S
Despite the UN SDGs, which are meant to be achieved by 2030, there was a consensual pessimism about the likely future landscape of 2068, reinforced by the pace of technological change, particularly the disruptive impact of AI and probable consequences for levels of unemployment, all of which will have implications for management education.;S
In this context, the authors consider whether PRME might still exist in 2068 and, if so, what it might look like.;S
The anticipation of such change is the rationale for imagining the United Nations (UN) initiative Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) in 2068 in an effort to explore the potential nature of responsible and sustainable management education in fifty years’ time.;S
The relevance of and potential change in the Principles by 2068, in context with the forces of change as found in the environmental scanning exercise, were the focus of this Futures study.;S
Certain themes emerged from the pilot that were suggested to be of particular importance for the future, for management education and as forces likely to influence the PRME discourse towards 2068, viz.;S
Examples of ‘wicked problems’ found in the discussions include: the relevance of PRME in its current form as a driver of sustainability given that Humanity’s very existence in 2068 may be considered to be uncertain the need for a broader involvement of institutions (beyond corporations) involved in the focus of PRME, pending the existence of the UN and globalisation in 2068 the need to address management and governance issues within PRME.;S
There was a view that the world of 2068 may be characterised by fundamental change in the geopolitical context, with countries potentially acting in a more isolationist way and in turn having implications for management arrangements and education.;S
This in turn raised perhaps the most fundamental of all questions i.e. whether humans, and other species, would even still exist in 2068.;S
We’re also seeing developments in technology, breakthrough innovation in spheres including energy, artificial intelligence, and these raise a lot of issues for management education in terms of risk, responsibility, ownership of data, access to data….and all this means we’ll be dealing with an unrecognisably different world in 2068.;S
I don’t think it’s about refinement, that would be too little…..In the1980s or even the 1990s the predominant way of thinking about business was shareholder-driven, very neo-liberal thinking, but right now with the [SDGs]…..we need a paradigm shift. [It] is hard to say by 2068 whether we will need a paradigm shift or whether we will already have gone through a couple…I think the institutions are what is stopping us from looking into paradigm shifts sometimes, the bureaucracy.;S
This reference to ‘institutions’ also links to a point made by several discussants that consideration of the Principles raises the issue of ‘ownership’, i.e. which institution(s) will be the main drivers of PRME in 2068 and what might be the possible impact on the Principles.;S
The above point links to some of the responses to Question 1 and Question 3 (below) and raises the question of the possible status of the UN and the UN Global Compact by 2068.;S
In its current form, I don’t think it ought to exist by 2068 and if it is still existing then, yes, it’s a failure. It’s already requiring a lot of reform…. If we keep on like this, first of all, it should not survive to 2068….If we reform, and manage to make PRME better, yes, it should still exist for a little bit longer but by 2068 if we are still talking about responsible management education, as if it is not the norm, then we have a problem.;S
In 50 years, the extent to which those from advantaged backgrounds understand the life of someone from a disadvantaged background.;S
In 2025 this track of land housed an experimental atom modifier, which during its explosion caused a chemical spill in a nearby plant. these two haphazard, hazardous events have chemically altered my body forever.;S
The 2030 agenda emphasises the SDGs are interlinked, and recognises the importance of ensuring integration across all the sectors they represent, without indicating ways in which this might be achieved.;S
However because of the inherent complexity of the inter-related dilemmas involved, attaining improvement toward one SDG by 2030 may come at the expense of another. Not knowing where to prioritise action is a consequence of the overwhelming scale of issues that need to be addressed. Furthermore, there are dangers if national planning strategies focus on a goal-by-goal and target by target approach, neglecting the mutual influences between them.;S
Whilst pragmatically focusing on the short term through to 2030, the lack of long-term planning has been highlighted by the absence of global population goals and boundaries in those targets considering environmental constraints, despite well-known connections between population growth and environmental degradation.;S
To deliver all the SDGs by 2030 will require a concerted global effort, in which both time and monetary constraints must be overcome. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of the inter-relationships and dependancies between the various goalSwith Stafford-Smith et al., 2016 noting: “there must be greater attention on inter-linkages in three areas: across sectors, across societal actors, and between and among low, medium and high-income countries.;S
Using a quantitative global simulation model called Earth have considered socio-economic and biophysical development through to 2050, and using one modelable indicator for each goal have assessed the number of SDGs likely to be achieved by 2030 and 2050.;S
In a business as usual scenario their results show human societies becoming richer (as measured by GDP per person) but people live in more unequal societies and in an environment increasingly damaged by human activity. Accelerating economic growth leads to higher GDP, more energy use, more CO2 emissions and more use of resources with 11 SDGs achieved by 2030 but with greater global pressures on planetary boundaries.;S
In a third scenario which sees a stronger policy focus on achieving the SDGs leads to more (but not all) goals being attained by 2030 and a halt in the downward trend of environmental goals. This leads to their conclusion that non-conventional - even transformational - action is required to create a sustainable world and satisfactory levels of well being for all.;S
The 2030 target is largely political, set for consistency to match the 15-year timeframe of the Millennium Development Goals. However, in light of the incomplete completion of the Millennium Development Goals, which only consisted of 17 targets across eight goals, it is unreasonable to think that in the same timeframe the Sustainable Development Goals will be achieved, which consist of 169 targets across 17 goals. Progress towards the completion of the Sustainable Development Goals is not linear, with many factors and causal connections within the system that will stagger the progress and thus the final achievement of the goals.;S
However, even by prioritising the foundational goals and feedback loops, it is unlikely that the 2030 target will be met.;S
The vaccines market is estimated to rise from the present value of $38 billion to over $70 billion by 2025.;S
A 2008 study found that southern Africa could lose 30 % of its maize crop by 2030 due to the negative effects of climate change. Losses of maize and rice crops in South Asia could also be significant.;S
Without further commitments and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the world is likely to warm by more than 3 °C above the preindustrial climate. Even with the current mitigation commitments and pledges fully implemented, there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4 °C by 2100. If they are not met, a warming of 4 °C could occur as early as the 2060s.;S
Such a warming level and associated sea-level rise of 0.5–1 meter, or more, by 2100 would not be the end point: a further warming to levels over 6 °C, with several meters of sea-level rise, would likely occur over the following centuries.;S
By 2050 , under a typical middle-of-the-road emissions scenario, you’re looking at a doubling of the volatility for grains in the midlatitudes. In places like China, the U.S., Europe, Ukraine—the breadbasket countries of the world—the volatility from year-to-year just from natural climate variability at a higher temperature is going to be much higher. The impact on crops is going to be greater and greater.;S
The most widely accepted view of population growth is the “demographic transition. If incomes continue to rise in most countries and richer people have fewer children, then world population should peak at 9–11 billion around the year 2100.;S
Over the next several thousand years, this dependence led to agriculture and large-scale state.;S
Societies.;S
Climate models indicate that the Earth could warm by 3°C-4 °C by the year 2100 and eventually by as much as 8 °C or more.;S
It took only a few thousand years after sedentary agriculture began for it to spread and become dominant in the Middle East, South Asia, China, and Mesoamerica.;S
In just the past 70 years human activity has increased atmospheric CO2 levels by 100 ppm to over 400 ppm, and the Earth’s average temperature has warmed by 1 °C. Unless draconian measures are taken to halt the increase in atmospheric CO2, global temperature will likely increase by at least 3 °C above today’s by the year 2100 and could eventually increase by 8 °C or more (the so-called mega-greenhouse).;S
After the initial establishment of agriculture there was a period of several thousand years of small, settled communities stateless societies that practiced a combination of agriculture and foraging.;S
Most projections of global warming focus on either the year 2100 or the effects of a doubling of CO2 (from the pre-industrial level of 275 ppm–550 ppm).;S
The lack of attention to the very long run is a serious shortcoming, since integrated carbon-climate models project that if CO2 from current in situ fossil fuel resources continues to be released into the atmosphere, the peak concentration of atmospheric CO2 could exceed 1400 ppm by the year 2300 and the average global temperature could warm by 8 °C or more.;S
In Europe, North America and Australia, 2.4 million people are predicted to die from infections with resistant microorganisms in the next 30 years and could cost up to US$3.5 billion per year.;S
A second example, the Association of Research Libraries (ARL US) 2030 scenarios , is represented by the matrix: (a) constraints on individual researchers, and (b) research enterprise aggregation. (Fig. D2). Constraints on researchers and level of research enterprise aggregation are, similarly, not variables ARL or its members may expect to significantly influence. The interviewee (see Table B1) stressed that the purpose was to create scenarios that were different to each other, without consideration to which of them might be preferred, in order to “think about different ways things could turn out, that is to inform adaptation to future eventualities beyond the ARL’s control.;S
Considering examples of successes of adaptive type, the Association of Research Libraries 2030 Scenarios , structured by exogenous axes, were used by librarians in perceiving and preparing for potential new industry externalities beyond ARL’s control, suggesting ways its systems and offerings may need adapting to remain current and competitive. Similarly, Bord Bia’s scenarios were used in follow-on workshops to stimulate Irish food and agriculture firms prepare themselves to operate in new food-chain and food-consumption environments the emergence of which they had very little control over. In such cases, the scenario projects were also reported to have been relevant in furthering the aims of their commissioning organizations. It is apparent that in these cases the scenario project purpose was exploratory and adaptive (“how do we shape ourselves to survive and thrive in view of macro-externalities we don’t much control?), and the scenario matrix purpose in each case was congruent to this.;S
The prediction market Metaculus uses trades with in-platform credits allowing individuals to perform actions such as posing their own questions. It has set up a market to establish the probability of human extinction (source 10), although the market clearing price, which will represent its ‘final’ prediction, will not be available until it closes in 2030.;S
For instance, one might reason that evidence about the adaptability of humans to environmental changes suggests a 30 % probability that we will survive the next 1000 years, but only a 10 % probability that we will not.4 Combination functions can then be used to aggregate these imprecise probabilities to return the overall probability of extinction within this period.;S
The market for engineering services has great potential in Russia and might well reach up to $7 billion by 2020, with a growth rate of 5%-7% per year.;S
By 2020-2030, annual growth rates are likely to increase and may exceed 10%-15%.;S
In recent times, the studies that cover the Russian oil and gas sector have been mainly dominated by institutional and macroeconomic perspectives. Paltsev (2014), for example, approaches the economic opportunities of Russia's natural gas exports through possible scenarios until 2050, including threats to Russian exports, such as the emerging shale gas technologies development across the globe, the EU energy policy (nuclear, non-nuclear, renewable), and the transformation of liquefied natural gas markets.;S
A sustainable development agenda for WIPO would surely encompass a broader understanding of development. The establishment of the UN’s SDGs in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is, in some respects, an effort, like the prior MDGs, to broaden the discourse and mandate of development beyond purely economic measures. Only three of the seventeen SDGs deal directly with economic or industrial development others focus on education (4), gender equality (5), inequality (11), and peace and justice (16), among others.;S

This is certainly the reason why some producers and distributors of food products (e.g. Carambar, Haribo, Mars, Picard, William Saurin, Carrefour, Super U, Leclerc) voluntarily undertook to suspend the use of E171 before the law comes into force. By the same token, in 2018 the French confectioners’ union also adopted a charter of ethics including the decision to ban E171 by 2020 , “to meet the expectations of civil society (IP1).;S
Given the rate and scale of economic change required to minimise climate risks (i.e. net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner), in navigating the terrain ahead we should expect that knowledge systems and practices established to deal with past and even current change processes will at best provide partial guidance, and at worst be misguiding.;S
It is estimated that artificial intelligence revolution will come into full force within the next twenty years.;S
In the EU, the 2020 Energy Strategy aims to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 20 % of consumption by 2020.;S
A study by Kallio, Salminen, and Sievänen (2013) created three scenarios for the year 2025 to compare the effects of wood energy on the carbon balance.;S
They found that for Finland to meet its EU target (38 % of national total energy consumption covered by renewable energy by 2020), the use of wood energy should be increased.;S
SDG 7 focuses on clean and affordable energy and aims for a substantial increase in the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030, whereas the sub-target of SDG13 addresses the national policies for climate change mitigation.;S
For example, Tapio, Rintamäki, Rikkonen, and Ruotsalainen (2017) created six energy scenarios for farms up to the year 2030. They showed that the role of wood burning will likely remain prominent in the future, whereas the role of other renewable energy sources varies in different scenarios.;S
Based on the National Energy and Climate Strategy for 2030 government report, the use of woodchips should increase significantly in the future due to increased use for heat and electricity production, as well as fuel production for transport (Huttunen, 2017).;S
The report estimates that in 2030, the use will be around 14–18 million m3 (Huttunen, 2017). This would mean at least a 100% increase compared to the current level.;S
However, the energy demand grows as well. Based on the existing energy policies and announced policy intentions, the amount of global energy consumption is projected to increase almost 80 % between 2016 and 2040.;S
The concept of futures image has seldom been applied in energy research. We identified four studies published in academic journals that had constructed futures images on either directly or partly related to future energy use. Wallgren and Höjer (2009) studied energy use in the food system. Their end result was a futures image of sustainable food consumption in 2050, wherein energy efficiency was the key component.;S
a profound mind shift toward universal values that re-connect world development with a resilient Earth, recognise the right of all to development and promote a shift from materialistic lifestyles to the pursuit of well-being and fulfilment.' (It would also involve) three critical transformations ... decarbonising the world economy by 2050 to 2070, feeding the world through sustainable agriculture by 2050 and accelerating progress toward an economy of cyclic material flows.;S
This point was made amply clear in a 2018 workshop at NordiCHI, a biennial conference that functions as the main Nordic forum for human-computer interaction research. A multidisciplinary group of researchers, academics, philosophers and ethicists explored the role of AI and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in the future of wisdom during the coming decades. ‘What will be the long-term consequences of HCI, AI, IoT, Big Data and Smart Technologies 50 years from now.;S
Brazil emits about 2.5 % of the world’s carbon dioxide and other polluting gases moreover, Brazil’s overall emissions increased steeply from 2010 (CDIAC, 2017). In September 2016, the country ratified the Paris Agreement (Agriocone, 2016), committing to reduce emissions by 37 % by 2025 and by 43 % by 2030, based on 2005 reference values.;S
The Brazilian population annual growth is about 0.8 %, slowing towards 0.5 % in 2030 and stabilizing at 240 million people around 2050.;S
Brazil is expected to become a major exporter of oil and to be the world’s 6th largest energy provider by 2035 (IEA, 2014).;S
In view of the interviewees’ perceptions and previous analysis, “policies and regulations can be considered as an uncertainty that could heavily affect the electricity market in general, and solar in particular, within the next 5 years.;S
I would bet you anything that that the solar energy supply doesn’t reach 10 Giga[Watts] in Brazil in the next 10 years as the government claims. Money in Brazil is very costly, so if you take out a loan to purchase your PV system, you will never pay back that loan with the savings on your energy bill.;S
Short-term decisions are in conflict with long-term ones. This happens not only in Brazil, but everywhere. A government generally thinks only about the next four to five years, a situation that results in sub-optimal decisions for the next 20, 30, or 50 years.;S
Technological advances, particularly in computerization, encourage firms to robotize, replacing unskilled jobs that can be easily routinized by machines. It is a common view that new disruptive technologies will burn more jobs than those the same technology will be able to generate in several industries (Kotler, 2015). According to Frey and Osborne (2017), 47 % of total US employment is in the high-risk category, being these jobs expected to be automated relatively soon, perhaps by 2023 or 2033.;S
Population by region, sex, age in 2050 is calculated based on population projection by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.;S
Future scenarios of passenger travel demand within daily life area in Japan in 2050 were calculated by a combination of two levels of change of the corresponding term of Mega-trend.;S
Passenger travel by non-motorized, motorized private, and motorized public transportation within daily life area in 2050 are 40 billion person-km/yr, 471 billion person-km/yr, and 377 billion person-km/yr in Population Change Only, 44 billion person-km/yr, 494 billion person-km/yr, and 411 billion person-km/yr in Socioeconomic Change Only, 88 billion person-km/yr, 356 billion person-km/yr, and 385 billion person-km/yr in Low Demand, and 29 billion person-km/yr, 852 billion person-km/yr, and 266 billion person-km/yr in High Accessibility, respectively.;S
Travel demand for commuting, work, and private trips in 2050 are 407 billion person-km/yr, 78 billion person-km/yr, and 402 billion person-km/yr in Population Change Only, 462 billion person-km/yr, 78 billion person-km/yr, and 409 billion person-km/yr in Socioeconomic Change Only, 373 billion person-km/yr, 79 billion personkm/yr, and 377 billion person-km/yr in Low Demand, and 545 billion person-km/yr, 98 billion person-km/yr, and 503 billion personkm/yr in High Accessibility, respectively.;S
Average distance with respect to average travel time per capita within daily life by mode of transportation in 2015−16, and the Socioeconomic Change Only, Low Demand, and High Accessibility scenarios in 2050.;S
Average per-capita travel distance and travel time by motorized public transportation by representative is in the range of 1−32 km/day and 1−66 min/day in 2015−16, 1−32 km/day and 1−65 min/day in Socioeconomic Change Only, 0−25 km/day and 0−52 min/day in Low Demand, and 0−22 km/day and 0−42 min/day in High Accessibility in 2050, respectively.;S
Average per-capita travel distance and travel time by motorized private transportation by representative is in the range of 4−46 km/day and 10−72 min/day in 2015−16, 5−42 km/day and 11−65 min/day in Socioeconomic Change Only, 3−36 km/day and 8−55 min/day in Low Demand, and 9−59 km/day and 17−103 min/day in High Accessibility in 2050, respectively.;S
Average per-capita travel distance and travel time by NMT by representative is in the range of 0−2 km/day and 3−23 min/day in 2015−16, 0−2 km/day and 4−23 min/day in Socioeconomic Change Only, 1−4 km/day and 10−44 min/day in Low Demand, and 0−2 km/day and 2−14 min/day in High Accessibility in 2050, respectively.;S
In Population Change Only, travel demand by motorized private transportation decreases by 28 % because the rural population is projected to decrease selectively in 2050.;S
In 2050, average distance and travel time within daily life in the Socioeconomic Change Only scenario shows little change except for women and those aged 65 and over compared to those in 2015−16.;S
Contrasting future passenger travel demand scenarios in Japan in 2050, that is, Low Demand and High Accessibility, were developed in accordance with qualitative scenarios and quantitative assumptions of four mega-trends: population aging, gender equality, tertiary industrialization, and transport technology innovation.;S
In the Low Demand scenario, total travel demand by motorized private transportation is found to decrease by 45 % in 2050 compared to that in 2015−16.;S
Automation has generated expectations regarding increased productivity, efficiency, safety, and convenience for employers, but it also threatens the current job positions, salaries, skills, and talents of the workforce and, above all, the nature of the work. From the point of view of automation experts, at least 35 % of the jobs currently available will be automated over the next twenty years, and a study conducted by the Mckinsey Global Institute predicted that by 2025, robotics may replace up to 75 million jobs worldwide. Even in the case of partial automation within a particular job, automation could impact all hierarchical levels from gardeners to managers.;S
The growth in the use of these platforms is rapid, and it is estimated that by 2025, nearly 540 million Internet users could use these platforms to find a job.;S
According to the OECD projections, single-parent families will increase in absolute terms and proportion with respect to households with children. In fact, by 2030, it is expected that the rate of single-parent households will increase in all OECD countries.;S
The uncertainty of this axis focuses on the issue of whether by 2040 in Mexico the contemporary traditional family will have disappeared and been replaced by more radical and complex forms of family agreements in households.;S
This issue is considered one of the greatest uncertainties because while there is a clear trend towards entrepreneurship economics and automation worldwide, we do not know whether the economic conditions, infrastructure and social acceptance are a breeding ground or barrier to the proliferation of this type of economy in Mexico in 2040.;S
In 2040, in Mexico, there are no working days, and everything is assigned by projects and resolved in the time that was committed for delivery.;S
In recent years, there has been an increase in life expectancy due to science and technology. The OECD predicts that life expectancy at birth will continue to increase until 80 and 90 years of age at the global level by 2050.;S
For example, discussing responsibility in management education, Henderson, Wersun, Wilson, Mo-ching Yeung, and Zhang (2019) equate responsible management with management for sustainability, in a context in which ‘Humanity's very existence in 2068 may be considered to be uncertain’.;S
The Good Anthropocene scenarios exhibit similarities with both of those narratives, though the GEO-6 scenarios are much more constrained by current trends and possibilities. Similarly, the vision put forth by Agenda 2063 for Africa (African Union Commission, 2015) is based on extrapolations of past and existing continental initiatives for sustainable growth and development, without significantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in a truly uncertain and exponentially changing Anthropocene.;S
The 2063 vision is focused on strengthening Africa’s role in a globalizing world, and aims to achieve the SDGs mainly through standard economic growth.;S
The 2063 vision is heavily embedded within conventional technological trends and does not emphasise the rich bio-cultural diversity of the continent.;S
NASA plans have included sending astronauts to Mars by 2035, and China also intends to build a lunar colony followed by a Mars colony. These plans are enabled by technological innovation. New materials allow rockets to be lighter, stronger, and cheaper to launch, as does the profit-driven design philosophy of Musk and Bezos.;S

The worldbuilding and artefact development processes enabled participants to develop detailed pathways to 2038 and create an artefact which would bring to life an aspect of their envisioned future.;S
The dominance of Transform archetypes continues, as participants envisioned six Transform and two Collapse future worlds. The role of technology in enabling transformative change is a key precondition across all future pathways. Three of the future worlds developed narrative arcs centred around a global state of crisis along the pathway to 2038.;S
Perhaps nowhere as in the specific case of mathematical modelling one has elements to detect an excessive use of the technique, something which might be called a quantification hubris. I have already mentioned the computation of the cost of climate action/ inaction at the year 2100, which pales when compared to what the authors in (Pilkey & Pilkey-Jarvis, 2009) call “A Million Years of Certainty relative to a model-based computation of the risk of a nuclear waste disposal one million years into the future.;S
