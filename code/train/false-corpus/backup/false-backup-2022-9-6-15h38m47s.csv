 OVERVIEW In this chapter we present the aim of this report.;N
 Introduction OVERVIEW 1.;N
INTRODUCTION Work has changed and it is changing, this could have been said at any time in history.;N
The very meaning of the word “work” is multiple and changed throughout time.;N
Etymologically, its origins go back to the Latin word tripalium which means a torture device [1].;N
In the Greek society, only slaves or second-class citizens used to work as it was mainly a physical activity considered undesirable by the upper-class people [2].;N
Work remained as an activity reserved for the unfortunate on the medieval ages as it was considered something terrible by the Catholic Church and the nobles [3].;N
The ethics of the religious denominations that derived from the Protestant Reformation went in direct opposition with the Catholic perspective of work by viewing it as a mean to salvation [4].;N
This change in the meaning of work was extremely important for the Industrial Revolution that was to follow for it provided the cultural and moral justification to keep people working for at least 16 hours per day.;N
The industrial revolutions deserve special consideration in the history of work as they represent “profound changes in the nd During the 2 In when electricity was production, work has a [5].;N
The characteristics o were further intensifie entrepreneurs such as the scientific administra and Ford that sough division and specializa creation of the produc electrification of prod machines substituted done by the people.;N
Fayol’s work helped to as the white-collar work The invention o Computation Technolo application on busines represent the main Industrial Revolution came new industries an the main product o became information an the economy (services the first time in history of GDP of several devel Robotics, Artificial and nanotechnology ar of the iceberg of what th 4 Industrial Revolut technologies are furthe The most likely scenario for work in 2050 presented in this report ma key points: 1.;N
Automation continues to advance in industry, in contrast to the regulations and laws on the subject, continuing projects of ins work in society.;N
 2.;N
Computerization will reduce the demand for low-skill and low-w period of unemployment, most people will train to new careers able to do so relying on the state to provide them a basic incom change to create new opportunities: some economies will redu avoiding unemployment of higher skilled people.;N
 3.;N
After a period of job insecurity and a series of disputes betwee of Employment workers and their employees, the new types of better regulated in order to provide minimum worker rights.;N
help workers in new NSEs to organize themselves in order to fi for better working conditions.;N
 4.;N
A transition to a personalized education process will be p technologies, which takes into account personal needs, interests 5.;N
This personalized education and the trend of jobs automation workload to the workers, giving them more free time to stud keeping them updated and involved in a lifelong learning.;N
 6.;N
Workers will receive knowledge-intensive training, allowing their types of jobs.;N
 7.;N
The collaboration and exchanges will increase, as well as the entrepreneurship in the global labor market.;N
 8.;N
The society will demand more transparency and participation in new technologies, although keeping the traditional struct Minorities will use these new technologies and mediums to stren for political empowerment.;N
 9.;N
The population will age and legislations will be amended s OVERVIEW bring some benefits for the society, as well as some new challenges.;N
The importance of this report relies in addressing these challenges as soon as possible in order to produce efficient results in our society.;N
We took some assumptions while performing our analysis until 2050.;N
The first one is that there will be no disruptive technological breakthrough.;N
The second one is that will be no large-scale war – although asymmetric conflicts will continue to exist.;N
Finally, the third one is that will be no global catastrophe.;N
Therefore, we pointed out the key themes that policy-makers, entrepreneurs and workers should discuss in the near future.;N
Although there is no right model to be followed, we believe that these actors should debate these topics: 1.;N
Robots and AI Regulation: should Robots and AI be limited or forbidden, highly taxed in order to support income transfer programs, or be left unregulated?;N
2.;N
Income transfer programs: should the government create income transfer programs?;N
If so, which model, Universal Basic Income, Universal Basic Assets or other?;N
3.;N
Non-Standard forms of egalitarian, participato society.;N
 PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK In this part, we analyze the key trends that drive t work.;N
 Increasing automation will impact your life PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 2.;N
INCREASING AUTOMATION WILL IMPACT YOUR LIFE Since the last century, computers have been routinely performing physical activities in industries, performing better and being cheaper than humans.;N
With new technologies, machines are getting closer to being able to make judgments and decisionmaking.;N
Formerly, such capacities were impossible for something non-human [14].;N
Today only 5% of occupations are candidates for total automation, with total loss of human tasks [14].;N
Even so, almost all professions have partial automation potential.;N
The impact of automation on workers is predictable in the production of physical products, especially in the retail and retail market.;N
Collection and data processing are also fully automatable and as we see the latest assembly line operations and archivists suffer from the same problem.;N
Some key points have to be considered when talking about adopting automation [14]: · Technical feasibility: The technique may be in the prototype phase, making it impossible to use it extensively.;N
 popular acceptanc adoption becomes The effects of auto at the macro level in t the micro level they ca increasing unemploym region or monopoly companies with automa 2.1.;N
WILL WE NEED PO ADVANCED AI AND Artificial Intelligenc for 60 years now, and o remarkable progress ha area.;N
In 2011, Watson designed by IBM, w questionnaires the cha Brad Rutter and Ken first moment in which humans in this type of c AlphaGo, one of intelligence systems, game challenge with L best professional Go p [15].;N
 The technological is in process.;N
The c memory, bandwidth, s have been falling e KEY TR reading emails, cleaning or even driving cars for us.;N
However, this will also impact our privacy, security, and ethics.;N
Many uncontrolled consequences can arise if we are unable to identify the previously related threats [15].;N
Building machines that can learn on their own is a key to this revolution, along with new regulatory policies.;N
Historically, we have an automation problem: if, for any reason, no human could explain all the steps taken in completing a task, then no programmer could incorporate those rules into software.;N
Recent advances shows that this is not a great obstacle to be overcome anymore.;N
Machines can learn even when humans cannot teach them and can learn more efficiently, since they can generate new knowledge alone and faster than humans [16].;N
Technological advances have an impact on the way work is done.;N
Such a radical reform of labor will require new policies to protect the vulnerable unprepared for the new age.;N
The choices made now will be decisive in the direction to be followed.;N
Erroneous interventions undermine the economic prospects of millions of people around the world, leaving underdeveloped nations out of the race against the automation yet, g technology and kn human behavior i intelligence [17].;N
 What we have automation will cre areas such as AI entirely new job additional wealth an This discussion for underdevelope the margin of the focus of studies in characteristics suit such cases, interve is required to ensu prepared for the ne share the potentia broadly with societ as increased inves vocational training Regarding the years the concept grown, so the num sets affect the r training.;N
Therefore applications will re data.;N
The privacy is exploiting this dat PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK intelligent transportation and logistics, smart building, environmental monitoring, medical and health care, among others.;N
[19].;N
Predictions for the number of connected devices on the Internet of Things for the year 2020 vary considerably, from Gartner 26 billion (Gartner) to 30 billion (ABI Research), to 50 billion (Cisco) to 75 billion (Morgan Stanley) [18].;N
The impact of IoT on industrial automation and control is increasingly present in society.;N
The evolution of sensor technologies that define the Internet of Things will lead to lower cost automation systems and production maximization.;N
The benefits of IoT include low-cost, highperformance processors, robust low-cost sensors, analytical software, vision systems, cloud computing, and highly distributed system architectures [20].;N
Many companies are seeking key knowledge to be applied for competitive advantage through Big Data analysis.;N
Therefore, companies that possess the skills needed to analyze and generate business intelligence from several sources of data in real time will take the lead in the market.;N
This trend follows the flow of increasingly society, in the case o smart meters that mon patients, seniors or chil Other implication issues should be ta especially in home auto of sensor data as a espionage [21].;N

Connect interaction, integrated KEY TR other hand, usually consists of readers and a large population of tags.;N
In addition, each tag has a small memory to store its unique ID and some other information, for example, product price, expiration date, personal information, and so on.;N
These labels may be managed through wireless network in real time, among other advantages over identification techniques such as magnetic stripe and bar code [23].;N
 3.;N
EMPLOYMENT WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING th The world faces the 4 Industrial Revolution which has a widespread impact on society, affecting education, employment, and skills, requiring stronger partnerships between governments, educators, training providers, workers and employers [24].;N
The main drivers of this revolution are artificial intelligence, machine learning, nanotechnology, 3D printing, robotics, biotechnology, and genetics each interacting in multiple directions and intensifying each other.;N
While new technologies are expected to promote a better society and well-being they can also represent threats to jobs and shall be proactively observed and adapted by, societies, governments, corporations, and individuals [24].;N

Even if this prediction seems more optimistic than the technological unemployment, it also has its dangers for society.;N
For the last two centuries, economists defended that the job displacement theory have been right but there is no economic law guaranteeing that most people automatically benefit from technological progress [35].;N
The occupations that are more likely to be computerized in the next decades are the ones with the lowest average median wages and the ones in which we are less likely to find people with a bachelor’s degree or better [36].;N
This trend should be a concern for society because the people that are more likely to lose their jobs are also the ones with least resources to change careers given that it requires enrolling in courses to acquire new creative and social skills [36].;N
Another trend that is likely to help to destroy some careers is the rise of the knowledge economy.;N
As the economy moves away from being dominated by the solutions that look to the work week [33].;N

 Local work will be refreshed to provide value on another sort of occupations, mainly motivated by the automation and its consequences, which will generate in the medium term the extinction of manual jobs, as well as the dangerous, dirty and risky jobs.;N
[26] [46].;N
Globalization will not overcome local work, but will promote modifications on how the work is done.;N
 3.3.;N
WILL I HAVE T LONG?;N
 Considering the flexibility of where the worker can be, as mentioned previously, centralized offices with hundreds of people that ignore the travel time of employees tends to change.;N
Distributed offices on multiple locations or even co-working spaces will promote a cost reduction to enterprises, becoming an alternative to central offices located on a fully commercial area [26].;N
Despite a global population of approximately six billion individuals, just the minority is considered part of the developed global workforce [47] [48].;N
It is estimated that 80 percent of the world’s population are at the bottom of the economic pyramid, and live predominantly In the past few increase in flexible models which fost part-time jobs and to the reformulatio the relationship b employer [25] [26].;N

This trend shall promote a significant impact on society as organizations will be able to keep on being competitive by having access to a bigger pool of skilled professionals thus reducing the shortage of specialists and the impact on social security systems [55] [25].;N
Considering the advances on Healthcare automation, increase in the use of continuous-health tracking devices, reduction of healthcare costs and human mistakes being extinguished due to automation, life expectancy and the time that an individual will be able to work and have an active participation in society will increase [56] [45].;N
 3.4.;N
HOW ABOUT MY LABOR RIGHTS?;N
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO) [57], “Non-Standard forms of Employment have become a contemporary feature of labor markets around the world”.;N
In South America, 6 out of 10 young people who get a job today do so in the informal economy [51].;N
This trend is not exclusive to countries in development, Petrie [58] predicts that 40% of the US labor force will be self-employed 3.;N

 Earnings Wages tend to be substantially lower for compared to those in standard employment.;N
 Working hours Working hours are more uncertain for work lower work-life balance.;N
 Occupational security and health Injury rates are higher among workers in NSE.;N
 Social security Social security coverage law sometimes exclu when they are covered, their employment result in worse benefits.;N
 Training Workers in NSE are less likely to receive on-the have negative repercussions on career deve young workers.;N
 Representation and other fundamental rights at work Workers in NSE may lack access to freedo collective bargaining rights either for legal reas more tenuous attachment to the workplace.;N
Th violations of their fundamental rights at work, i and forced labor.;N
 Firms Firms that rely heavily on NSE need to adapt strategies from training and development of identifying the sets of skills that the firm n market.;N
An over-reliance on NSE can lead to a specific skills in the organization, limiting its changing market demand.;N
 Labor markets and society Widespread use of NSE may reinforce labor leading to a greater volatility in employment economic stability.;N
 PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK harder for workers on the new NSE to organize and to form unions.;N
Crowdworkers, for instance, are facing a challenging goal due to their geographical distribution that makes it harder to create solidarity between the workers in this particular category [60].;N
On the other side, the very spread and growth of some companies in the gig economy could make it easier for worker’s organizations to aim at them ( i.e.;N
by increasing vertical integration in some traditionally highly fragmented sectors such as car-hailing services) [62].;N
The labor movement survived recent changes in economy in two ways, and maybe these practices can be used in the future.;N
The first one involves using the same technology that is partly responsible for the creation of some of the new NSE and for the intensification of globalization to help workers organize.;N
This is already being done as shown by the following examples.;N
1 App-Based Drivers Association (ABDA) is a group from Seattle (United States) that aims to give a voice to app-based (e.g.;N
Uber, Lyft) drivers.;N
This association allows new members to join it by filling an online form on their website.;N
This group had a major win in 2015 when a law was passed by the city of Seattle allowing the car-haling app drivers to form unions [60] [62].;N
 from traditional union actors.;N
Unions can see demand economy as a members [60].;N

With a role in educat knowledge-based w possibility is to development of int genetics, viruses [65 UPDATED With the big changes coming to work, education will need to adapt using advancements in technology to achieve this change.;N
As work becomes more and more demanding of the skilled workforce with a deep knowledge of their skills, the education system will need to train new, more specialized workers, with some forms of work ceasing to exist and new jobs emerging [44].;N
Changes in education are usually reactive: there is a tendency to continue the process of training workers to (soon-to-be) old jobs in order to serve current job market, creating a gap for the new ones.;N
The world will need to adapt to a new way of teaching so that people’s competences are not outdated and lose job opportunities [44].;N
This is a major change in how we feel about work today, when an individual study during his youth and then chooses a career that tends to be kept the same during the life.;N
In the future, we will have to keep on learning throughout life to adapt to different jobs.;N
As it can be seen, the social 4.1.;N
DO WE NEED N The increasing transforming ind models, changing t need and reduci employees’ skill se people will have different skills to s PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK requires an investment in education of years.;N
The future worker will need a different set of skills when compared to the present ones: they need more cognitive skills, such as critical thinking and non-routine problem solving, interpersonal skills, such as presentation skills and conflict resolution, and intrapersonal skills, such as adaptability and self-development [70].;N
Jobs intensive in social and creative skills have a low risk of automation [67].;N
Thus, six important skills that students can develop are: collaboration, knowledge construction, skilled communication, self-regulation, realworld problem-solving, and use of information and communication technology for learning [71].;N
The rise in the demand of highly skilled workers tends to occur simultaneously to the rise in the demand of lower level jobs, especially in services – jobs requiring low or no skills are projected to grow [69].;N
Literacy and numeracy are fundamental skills [72], and team working and communication are important skills for most jobs [69].;N

 4.3.;N
WILL SELF-EMPLOYMENT SAVE THE WORLD ?;N
The labor market has a significant presence of self-employed workers – small traders, doctors, basic manufacturers, lawyers, freelance handymen, smallholder farmers.;N
Self-employment is not only a solution for individuals who have not found such as Airbnb.;N
We trends – i.e., the depends on the e scenario of econom unemployment, the complements the w However, in a sc economic or labo collaborative econo possible option for As an agent to PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK However, it does not reduce the importance of traditional self-employment governmental programs that provide business training, technical support, and financial assistance, giving to freelancer workers a better understanding of all aspects of starting and operating a new business [84].;N
This training is an effective program for assisting unemployed workers interested in self-employment to start their own business, remain self-employed, and avoid unemployment for long periods [84].;N
 4.4.;N
WILL EVERYONE RECEIVE ADVANCED EDUCATION AND TRAINING?;N
As a part of these new, big changes, workers in the future will shift from having generalist ability to having specialist ability [44], at the higher levels of knowledge or at lower ones.;N
As technology advances, educated workers tend to benefit more and those less educated tend to have their jobs automated first [70].;N
For instance, the manufacturing industry went from craftsmanship to the factory system, changing dynamically from mechanized powered systems to the present-day trend towards application of advanced manufacturing technology (computerized design, planning, and manufacturing tools such as CAD, CAM and MRP).;N

Servitization, Informatization, Digitalization, and Creativization will be new digital services [92].;N
Public services that provide social welfare as services for digital cities will be based on jointly resource-conscious, facilitating innovation and creativity, functioning as a service economy [93].;N
In fact, this transition from traditional models to more transparent and agile models is a symptom that covers many areas from software development to service exchanges and micro-pay according to the time you spend running a given demand.;N
In addition, the idea of creative cities is also related to an agenda and progressive planning including aspects of sustainability and social inclusion [94].;N
New productive arrangements have been tested, mainly due to the relationship functioning of lar and showing a new where creativity, c and agility are fund In the other moving to become Such organizations cultivate and trans to modify people a on the motivation insights and brains engagement [95].;N

Elderly population, as a percentage of total populati people's productive age will get larger, causing an increase in the economically active population.;N
Thus, longer lives imply changes in pension systems, as well as workers going beyond the normal retirement age for better pension.;N
The delayed retirement is a phenomenon in which elderly population keeps their labor force participation.;N
This is a recent phenomenon and is more noticeable in high-income workers and in less physically demanding occupations.;N
Workers whom delay the retirement also may delay claiming Social Security benefits [97].;N
In general, rules for eligibility to retire and claiming a pension benefit are complex and vary according to each government Bosworth et al.;N

In summary, if the trend in increase of gender equality sustains itself over the next decades, a reduction in the rate of increase of economic inequality can be expected [100].;N
Gender equality itself has been improving over the last decades but there is still a lot to be done for women rights in several countries with some critical cases as some countries in North Africa and Middle East.;N

Thinking of forms of regimes, implemented by nations, UBI would play out differently in each of these regimes, and in relation to the diverse set of existing policies in each [107].;N
In the other hand, the Institute for the 10 Future understands that Universal Basic Assets (UBA) is a fairer way of challenging inequality.;N
The UBA is a core set of resources that everyone should have, including housing, education, healthcare and financial security and has been proposed as a way to avoid economic disasters by properly assessing and distributing our resources to meet the needs of each person.;N
It can be seen as an evolution of the UBI concept, which gives each citizen a fixed amount of guaranteed Following the d a phenomenon call is predicted by so This phenomenon Gross Domestic developed countrie Today, we already activity shifting from means that dev increasing at a larg capital and people [ Countries like Indonesia and Me their GDP an ave percent per yea Indonesia are like larger in terms of PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK Figure 6.;N

Also, while some countries are rapidly growing, some of them are not growing at all, increasing the gap between developed and underdeveloped countries [116].;N
Inequality has significant implications on the macroeconomic stability on 2050 as it tends to concentrate the power in the hands of the few.;N
Inequality can lead to suboptimal use of human resources, cause investment reduction, and political and economic instability [116].;N

Developing countries can find an opportunity to lead the creation of new IPs while exploiting technologies and challenges that developed countries and avoiding to commit the same mistakes of the developed countries [119].;N
The growing number of IPs in the developing countries can cause some harm too.;N
The great number of new patents and IPs can cause a scenario of choking and blocking of the technology creation [119].;N
This phenomenon, caused by low standard IPs, can be avoided by the creation of new, and more rigid standards for registering a new patent, and causing an over-protection of the IPs a country currently holds [119].;N

WILL AUTOMATION DESTROY OR ENHANCE THE E CONOMY ?;N
Technology alone will not determine economic results in terms of growth, inequality, or employment.;N
All leading economies have had access to similar levels of technology, but have had very different outcomes throughout history because they have had different institutions and policies [121].;N
Although today less than 5% of the occupations can be fully automated [14], the increasing automation will affect almost all occupations, not only factory workers and employees, but also landscaping gardeners and dental laboratory technicians, stylists, insurance sales representatives and CEOs to a greater or lesser extent.;N
Technological progress is the main driver of per capita GDP growth, allowing output to rise faster than labor and capital.;N
Increases in labor productivity generally translate into increases in average wages, giving workers the opportunity to reduce working hours and offer more goods and services [121].;N

The Academy can invest in new ways of learning and the government may create regulation for the society and markets [99].;N
Basic income is a policy that may be created by a government in order to decrease inequality – minimum wage is a common example of this type of social policy.;N
This subject is much debated among specialists in the area and is also controversial.;N
In a very short and reduced explanation, some of them, more liberal, consider that basic income and minimum wages can cause a disequilibrium in the labor market [125].;N
One of the consequences is inflation.;N
In the other point of view, minimum wages and basic income are an important public policy to reduce wage inequality and to have more equality between people.;N
Some studies consider that basic income and minimum wages can accelerate the market through stimulated aggregate demand [126].;N
 PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2 In this part, we develop three scenarios for the the optimistic, which considers the best outcome f the pessimist, which considers the worst, and the considers the trends we judged most probable.;N
 Optimistic Scenario PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 7.;N
OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO In this scenario, we present an optimistic foresight in how working will be in the year of 2050.;N
Using the trending changes identified in the Key Trends of the Future, we present our view for the next years if the best of the changes come to be.;N
 7.1.;N
AUTOMATION In this scenario we will not reach the singularity – a point where AI triggers an intelligence explosion, but on the other hand, we will absorb a strong impact on the way of processing data and information more quickly influenced by quantum computation.;N
Artificial Intelligence will be controlled by global and democratic regulations among nations to prevent their undue use as the domination of humankind by machines.;N
Artificial Intelligence will provide a scenario in 2050 of profound changes in work, replacing humans with robots and software in various areas, especially in tasks that do not use critical thinking and the accumulation of knowledge acquired by human learning experiences.;N
In this way, humans will adapt to a new reality of man-machine synergy in the More jobs opportuniti increase, which induce and investment.;N
Finally induces the production more jobs, in a virtuous With companies b more money from th workers, they can theo benefits for those work lower the prices, thes more goods with the money.;N
 Automation does human work obsolete, it, by replacing parts o we will have plausible m people deciding betwe will be ranked ac automation potential.;N
 7.2.;N
EMPLOYMENT In this scenario, bo companies will recogni workers that will lose automation and will f predictively.;N
This will a the benefits of au reduction of the co elimination of repetitive A VIEW OF keep informed of the trends in employment and use the same technology that disrupt work for their benefit.;N
Globalization will reach its most beneficial potential with workers dispersed around the world collaborating via computational tools such as augmented and virtual reality.;N
This computer-mediated work will allow people to do more homework bringing workers closer to their families and neighborhood lives and, more importantly for the globalization impact, they will not need to leave their home countries in order to find work.;N
 7.3.;N
EDUCATION education will gro STEM jobs will be future world.;N
The integration would only by grafting it o but by changing its the adaptation of th into new ones, that As this new e structured, there regularization or in However, as we ma education we still n assert that the hi remains.;N
 7.4.;N
SOCIAL WELFA We can see as a consequence of the trending changes and advancements of education, learning will be mostly selftaught, there will be easy and fast access to high quality education, alas the education will be even more specialized and knowledge-intensive generating a deep improvement in the workforce that will be more qualified.;N
With the increasing personalization of education and its importance to the new jobs needs, self-taught provides a higher adaptability to the worker.;N
Rather than In this scenario retire early and th people to spend o in their free time.;N
 Natural and preserved and exp technology, par broadens and all protected, reducing Universal Basic implemented.;N
Cou cheaper and susta PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 countries on G20 grow their GDP at an average rate of three to four percent a year and the top economies of the world change.;N
Countries like Brazil, Indonesia, India and Mexico closes their technology gap with the developed countries, increasing their GDP and creating a favorable environment for new business opportunities, allowing their population to engage on the new opportunities.;N
All this advancement in technology is extremely important for workers, as it helps them to develop and update their knowledge and skills.;N
In a world where everyone will have access to the internet, the ability to learn new things from open and free learning platforms will reduce the unemployment impact, because people will acquire new skills, mitigating the technology unemployment.;N
Thus, these technological advances will slow down the growth in inequality, the creation of new jobs and people having more free time to spend with family and to have fun.;N
In 2050, the rapid growth of the global population also starts to decrease and the population stabilizes around ten billion people.;N
With the increased population number, more cities start to appear.;N
People start to migrate from larger cities to smaller 8.1.;N
AUTOMATION In this scenario advance quicker th becoming increasingly a high unemployment see the benefits of chan workers for more pr Public policies to help this scenario will not b big portion of society ou The owners of algorithms that ca unemployment will “ow their products to the work.;N
 Therefore, new te IoT will not fulfill it because of the lack of d its costs.;N
Governments fail to realize such tec for the improvement industrial applications o of cities by the use o instance.;N
 8.2.;N
EMPLOYMENT In this scenario, technological unemploy A VIEW OF higher than in present with the increase of poverty.;N
As wars continue to be waged – mainly on the Middle East – and climate change makes few coastal regions uninhabitable.;N
Thus, immigration is expected to increase causing impacts in the places that receive these fluxes such as higher unemployment rates and lower average wages.;N
Furthermore, the intensification of the globalization of the workforce will increase immigration from poorer countries to richer ones.;N
In this scenario, the loss of jobs to foreign workers will be made easier by advances in IT, which will allow companies to hire workers from wherever they cost less.;N
Companies will not reduce working hours making some women feel that working conflicts with their interest of having children and the elderly are unable to find jobs because they need more time than young workers to take care of their health, spend time with the family and rest.;N
The reluctance of changing working hours creates a phenomenon where a small group of people works 8 or more hours while a great number of people do not have themselves despite Being harder to f conditions will mak a downward spira labor rights.;N

Most w PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 population will not receive the equal access for education and training because this advance will not achieve everybody.;N
Some people will be to continue receiving a bad education either training or none of training to adapt for change jobs rapidly.;N
Open Access initiatives will fail due its high costs, increasing the number of people unprepared for to work.;N
Besides, MOOCs will be unsuccessful for part of population because for accept this kind of platform the technology must be integrated with people and Government needs to interfere.;N
Only part of the population with a minimum technology are going to receive this accept and they will occupy the jobs, concentrating the labor with them.;N
The MOOCs such other forms to learn will not be regulated from Government, decreasing the quality of the service.;N
This unfair access to information will hamper the knowledge acquisition process and reinforce the unpreparedness for most people.;N
The knowledge-intensive jobs will be rare expensive because of this inducing the significantly difference between demand and offer.;N
This cost raise will difficult the entrance of new competitors – reinforcing the existing elite.;N

Other minorities, such afrodescendants, and immigrants, will suffer as alt-right, and supremacist movements get more support.;N
In this wave of conservative thought, LGBTI community will also see almost no advancement of their rights – and possibly some regress.;N
As countries face rising inequality, nationalist groups will increase in power and, as seen previously in history, immigrants will be pointed as responsible for all the evils in the developed countries.;N
Wars, climate change and increasing poverty will intensify immigration adding more fuel to the xenophobic movement.;N
Ideas such as Universal Basic Income and Universal Basic Assets will not gain strength and will not be applied in most countries.;N
This will only worsen the situation of the portion of society unable to find a job, which will be left to starve.;N
Part of this “extremely poor class” will not accept their situation in the economy, creating a security problem for governments as crimes rates increase.;N
Machines will have a strong role in imposing rules on the population.;N
Given the great social inequality, laws and security will be realized through machines.;N

LIKELY SCENAR PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 considering the benefits provided by automation, the government will keep an eye on the unemployment rates in order to keep it controlled while promoting economic growth.;N
The balance between automation and society demands is the key point to establish a virtuous circle in the automation expansion.;N
 services and products at the same time, a po lose their jobs, being fo ones even if not prepar and governments will measures to reduce automation to society a the economy.;N
 Governments will promote regulatory policies, in order to control the balance of the advancement in industry automation without locking it up and avoid the side effect of mass unemployment (or at least contain its fast growth).;N
Such policies will aim at protecting vulnerable people who will not be ready for this transformation.;N
In a first moment, only jobs that involve a high creativity load will remain unaffected because of the lack of technology to emulate this behavior on AI.;N
Governments and institutions will be able to contain this effect by investment and strengthening of education, with the aim of teaching new jobs in areas that will emerge.;N
Thus, governance institutions will be able to play a key role in this scenario as mediators between technology advances and people needs.;N
 Computerization reduction of low-skill Most of these p unemployment and stimulated to reduce th training their workers complete automation government will prov income.;N
This smoother fewer damages to soc keep consuming and th stable.;N
 Technologies such as IoT will continue to grow along with its demand.;N
The Communication globally as easier ac extensions and wirele cheapen the access t countries.;N
There will be between internation markets.;N
More people i will be able to work by quality of outsourcing and the prices will be A VIEW OF The government, motivated by the risk of reduction of the consumer market, will promote the flexibility of working hours, increasing the employment rate and the economic growth.;N
The medium and lowskilled workers that keep their jobs will face a reduction from the traditional 40 hours to 32 hours per week, gaining more time to use as desired.;N
This change will reduce the salaries.;N
To high-skilled workers, the flexibility will be an option considering that they will be a scarce workforce and the wage will be open to negotiation.;N
After a period of job insecurity and a series of disputes between Non-Standard forms of Employment (NSE) workers and their employees, the new types of work contracts will be better regulated in order to provide minimum rights.;N
These changes on regulation tend to improve the quality of services and reduce the conflicts between employers and employees on this job category Considering the new forms of employment, workers will not necessarily be associated to traditional trade unions as the ones we know.;N
It will take some time for these movements to be recognized by employers and by governments, but as soon as it happens, this movement will with current meth happens today, on progressively assum in this future new s Such progress in the labor market be deeper in kno adaptation to kn which are the stron again, governments helping and align th needed skills.;N
Add of education meth automation will m workload to the wo time to study and them updated opportunities in eac in the future, as learning.;N
Thus, a population will be needs of the new r the educational te not reach everybod of workers margina more qualified.;N
 Another impo influence of freedo versatility provided self-employment.;N
In PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 power to resist change, legislative power (policy makers) will be the most impacted.;N
The most radical groups will polarize the discussions in the political arena.;N
This phenomenon is a consequence of the greater dissemination of their ideas and convictions.;N
Moderates, in contrast, will be attacked from both sides and, thus, losing part of their representativeness.;N
Besides, minorities will also be able to join forces and empower themselves to confront social issues.;N
Broad dissemination of information and education will play important roles in promoting the protection of fundamental rights.;N
The role of the government will be to promote discussions on the platforms and to provide citizens with the most impartial information as possible, so that digital democracy can be put into practice.;N
In addition, it must execute, with the support and popular participation, the winning proposals.;N
With greater participation of the population in decisions, governments tend to increase the regulation of corporate actions, thus reducing the political power that large corporations have in the political arena.;N
 Another importan reduction of social in distribution of incom increased taxation t taxation in large corpo fortunes of the peopl received by the heirs, distribute wealth to society, promoting a b most vulnerable.;N
Bec impact on society, t Income should not rea and inequalities will con 9.5.;N
ECONOMY In this scenario, c China, India, Indones likely to grow their GDP to four percent per Indonesia are likely larger than the United while Pakistan and Eg Italy and Canada on Parity (PPP) basis.;N
In t year, Vietnam, India an the fastest growing eco 2050.;N
 GDP will not be t measure how fast a co itself – others indexes A VIEW OF this role.;N
The definition of new ways of working, basic income and new public policies will be decisive tasks to the government.;N
Countries that are prepared to it will succeed, the rest of them must learn how to deal with it.;N
There is not a recipe.;N
For that reason, the rules related to create new ways of employment and diversities of public policies does not apply to all countries.;N
Governments have to find ways to reinvent themselves, adapting to their specificities and building their own public policies, possible mitigating the automation effects.;N
In addition, free market may also help society.;N
There will be other ways to organize production.;N
Alternative, sharing, social, green and creative economy will become more popular.;N
Social banks will be important allies for that process.;N
They can finance these initiatives, so that is important to create new jobs, moving economy and mitigating poverty.;N
Although a worldwide-growth scenario is positive, this scenario is the one that slow down the inequality increase.;N
Inequality may be considered the gap between the richest people and the poorest people.;N
In the future, government will have an important role in this discussion.;N
It is the second, people liv migrating to urban the developed, and world will be ur shows some negat urbanization may c of cities, health ha water pollution and other hand, urb expenses on tran create cultural dive Cities will b connected.;N

 OVERVIEW In this chapter we present the aim of this report.;N
 Introduction OVERVIEW 1.;N
INTRODUCTION Work has changed and it is changing, this could have been said at any time in history.;N
The very meaning of the word “work” is multiple and changed throughout time.;N
Etymologically, its origins go back to the Latin word tripalium which means a torture device [1].;N
In the Greek society, only slaves or second-class citizens used to work as it was mainly a physical activity considered undesirable by the upper-class people [2].;N
Work remained as an activity reserved for the unfortunate on the medieval ages as it was considered something terrible by the Catholic Church and the nobles [3].;N
The ethics of the religious denominations that derived from the Protestant Reformation went in direct opposition with the Catholic perspective of work by viewing it as a mean to salvation [4].;N
This change in the meaning of work was extremely important for the Industrial Revolution that was to follow for it provided the cultural and moral justification to keep people working for at least 16 hours per day.;N
The industrial revolutions deserve special consideration in the history of work as they represent “profound changes in the nd During the 2 In when electricity was production, work has a [5].;N
The characteristics o were further intensifie entrepreneurs such as the scientific administra and Ford that sough division and specializa creation of the produc electrification of prod machines substituted done by the people.;N
Fayol’s work helped to as the white-collar work The invention o Computation Technolo application on busines represent the main Industrial Revolution came new industries an the main product o became information an the economy (services the first time in history of GDP of several devel Robotics, Artificial and nanotechnology ar of the iceberg of what th 4 Industrial Revolut technologies are furthe The most likely scenario for work in 2050 presented in this report ma key points: 1.;N
Automation continues to advance in industry, in contrast to the regulations and laws on the subject, continuing projects of ins work in society.;N
 2.;N
Computerization will reduce the demand for low-skill and low-w period of unemployment, most people will train to new careers able to do so relying on the state to provide them a basic incom change to create new opportunities: some economies will redu avoiding unemployment of higher skilled people.;N
 3.;N
After a period of job insecurity and a series of disputes betwee of Employment workers and their employees, the new types of better regulated in order to provide minimum worker rights.;N
help workers in new NSEs to organize themselves in order to fi for better working conditions.;N
 4.;N
A transition to a personalized education process will be p technologies, which takes into account personal needs, interests 5.;N
This personalized education and the trend of jobs automation workload to the workers, giving them more free time to stud keeping them updated and involved in a lifelong learning.;N
 6.;N
Workers will receive knowledge-intensive training, allowing their types of jobs.;N
 7.;N
The collaboration and exchanges will increase, as well as the entrepreneurship in the global labor market.;N
 8.;N
The society will demand more transparency and participation in new technologies, although keeping the traditional struct Minorities will use these new technologies and mediums to stren for political empowerment.;N
 9.;N
The population will age and legislations will be amended s OVERVIEW bring some benefits for the society, as well as some new challenges.;N
The importance of this report relies in addressing these challenges as soon as possible in order to produce efficient results in our society.;N
We took some assumptions while performing our analysis until 2050.;N
The first one is that there will be no disruptive technological breakthrough.;N
The second one is that will be no large-scale war – although asymmetric conflicts will continue to exist.;N
Finally, the third one is that will be no global catastrophe.;N
Therefore, we pointed out the key themes that policy-makers, entrepreneurs and workers should discuss in the near future.;N
Although there is no right model to be followed, we believe that these actors should debate these topics: 1.;N
Robots and AI Regulation: should Robots and AI be limited or forbidden, highly taxed in order to support income transfer programs, or be left unregulated?;N
2.;N
Income transfer programs: should the government create income transfer programs?;N
If so, which model, Universal Basic Income, Universal Basic Assets or other?;N
3.;N
Non-Standard forms of egalitarian, participato society.;N
 PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK In this part, we analyze the key trends that drive t work.;N
 Increasing automation will impact your life PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 2.;N
INCREASING AUTOMATION WILL IMPACT YOUR LIFE Since the last century, computers have been routinely performing physical activities in industries, performing better and being cheaper than humans.;N
With new technologies, machines are getting closer to being able to make judgments and decisionmaking.;N
Formerly, such capacities were impossible for something non-human [14].;N
Today only 5% of occupations are candidates for total automation, with total loss of human tasks [14].;N
Even so, almost all professions have partial automation potential.;N
The impact of automation on workers is predictable in the production of physical products, especially in the retail and retail market.;N
Collection and data processing are also fully automatable and as we see the latest assembly line operations and archivists suffer from the same problem.;N
Some key points have to be considered when talking about adopting automation [14]: · Technical feasibility: The technique may be in the prototype phase, making it impossible to use it extensively.;N
 popular acceptanc adoption becomes The effects of auto at the macro level in t the micro level they ca increasing unemploym region or monopoly companies with automa 2.1.;N
WILL WE NEED PO ADVANCED AI AND Artificial Intelligenc for 60 years now, and o remarkable progress ha area.;N
In 2011, Watson designed by IBM, w questionnaires the cha Brad Rutter and Ken first moment in which humans in this type of c AlphaGo, one of intelligence systems, game challenge with L best professional Go p [15].;N
 The technological is in process.;N
The c memory, bandwidth, s have been falling e KEY TR reading emails, cleaning or even driving cars for us.;N
However, this will also impact our privacy, security, and ethics.;N
Many uncontrolled consequences can arise if we are unable to identify the previously related threats [15].;N
Building machines that can learn on their own is a key to this revolution, along with new regulatory policies.;N
Historically, we have an automation problem: if, for any reason, no human could explain all the steps taken in completing a task, then no programmer could incorporate those rules into software.;N
Recent advances shows that this is not a great obstacle to be overcome anymore.;N
Machines can learn even when humans cannot teach them and can learn more efficiently, since they can generate new knowledge alone and faster than humans [16].;N
Technological advances have an impact on the way work is done.;N
Such a radical reform of labor will require new policies to protect the vulnerable unprepared for the new age.;N
The choices made now will be decisive in the direction to be followed.;N
Erroneous interventions undermine the economic prospects of millions of people around the world, leaving underdeveloped nations out of the race against the automation yet, g technology and kn human behavior i intelligence [17].;N
 What we have automation will cre areas such as AI entirely new job additional wealth an This discussion for underdevelope the margin of the focus of studies in characteristics suit such cases, interve is required to ensu prepared for the ne share the potentia broadly with societ as increased inves vocational training Regarding the years the concept grown, so the num sets affect the r training.;N
Therefore applications will re data.;N
The privacy is exploiting this dat PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK intelligent transportation and logistics, smart building, environmental monitoring, medical and health care, among others.;N
[19].;N
Predictions for the number of connected devices on the Internet of Things for the year 2020 vary considerably, from Gartner 26 billion (Gartner) to 30 billion (ABI Research), to 50 billion (Cisco) to 75 billion (Morgan Stanley) [18].;N
The impact of IoT on industrial automation and control is increasingly present in society.;N
The evolution of sensor technologies that define the Internet of Things will lead to lower cost automation systems and production maximization.;N
The benefits of IoT include low-cost, highperformance processors, robust low-cost sensors, analytical software, vision systems, cloud computing, and highly distributed system architectures [20].;N
Many companies are seeking key knowledge to be applied for competitive advantage through Big Data analysis.;N
Therefore, companies that possess the skills needed to analyze and generate business intelligence from several sources of data in real time will take the lead in the market.;N
This trend follows the flow of increasingly society, in the case o smart meters that mon patients, seniors or chil Other implication issues should be ta especially in home auto of sensor data as a espionage [21].;N

Connect interaction, integrated KEY TR other hand, usually consists of readers and a large population of tags.;N
In addition, each tag has a small memory to store its unique ID and some other information, for example, product price, expiration date, personal information, and so on.;N
These labels may be managed through wireless network in real time, among other advantages over identification techniques such as magnetic stripe and bar code [23].;N
 3.;N
EMPLOYMENT WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING th The world faces the 4 Industrial Revolution which has a widespread impact on society, affecting education, employment, and skills, requiring stronger partnerships between governments, educators, training providers, workers and employers [24].;N
The main drivers of this revolution are artificial intelligence, machine learning, nanotechnology, 3D printing, robotics, biotechnology, and genetics each interacting in multiple directions and intensifying each other.;N
While new technologies are expected to promote a better society and well-being they can also represent threats to jobs and shall be proactively observed and adapted by, societies, governments, corporations, and individuals [24].;N

Even if this prediction seems more optimistic than the technological unemployment, it also has its dangers for society.;N
For the last two centuries, economists defended that the job displacement theory have been right but there is no economic law guaranteeing that most people automatically benefit from technological progress [35].;N
The occupations that are more likely to be computerized in the next decades are the ones with the lowest average median wages and the ones in which we are less likely to find people with a bachelor’s degree or better [36].;N
This trend should be a concern for society because the people that are more likely to lose their jobs are also the ones with least resources to change careers given that it requires enrolling in courses to acquire new creative and social skills [36].;N
Another trend that is likely to help to destroy some careers is the rise of the knowledge economy.;N
As the economy moves away from being dominated by the solutions that look to the work week [33].;N

 Local work will be refreshed to provide value on another sort of occupations, mainly motivated by the automation and its consequences, which will generate in the medium term the extinction of manual jobs, as well as the dangerous, dirty and risky jobs.;N
[26] [46].;N
Globalization will not overcome local work, but will promote modifications on how the work is done.;N
 3.3.;N
WILL I HAVE T LONG?;N
 Considering the flexibility of where the worker can be, as mentioned previously, centralized offices with hundreds of people that ignore the travel time of employees tends to change.;N
Distributed offices on multiple locations or even co-working spaces will promote a cost reduction to enterprises, becoming an alternative to central offices located on a fully commercial area [26].;N
Despite a global population of approximately six billion individuals, just the minority is considered part of the developed global workforce [47] [48].;N
It is estimated that 80 percent of the world’s population are at the bottom of the economic pyramid, and live predominantly In the past few increase in flexible models which fost part-time jobs and to the reformulatio the relationship b employer [25] [26].;N

This trend shall promote a significant impact on society as organizations will be able to keep on being competitive by having access to a bigger pool of skilled professionals thus reducing the shortage of specialists and the impact on social security systems [55] [25].;N
Considering the advances on Healthcare automation, increase in the use of continuous-health tracking devices, reduction of healthcare costs and human mistakes being extinguished due to automation, life expectancy and the time that an individual will be able to work and have an active participation in society will increase [56] [45].;N
 3.4.;N
HOW ABOUT MY LABOR RIGHTS?;N
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO) [57], “Non-Standard forms of Employment have become a contemporary feature of labor markets around the world”.;N
In South America, 6 out of 10 young people who get a job today do so in the informal economy [51].;N
This trend is not exclusive to countries in development, Petrie [58] predicts that 40% of the US labor force will be self-employed 3.;N

 Earnings Wages tend to be substantially lower for compared to those in standard employment.;N
 Working hours Working hours are more uncertain for work lower work-life balance.;N
 Occupational security and health Injury rates are higher among workers in NSE.;N
 Social security Social security coverage law sometimes exclu when they are covered, their employment result in worse benefits.;N

 Representation and other fundamental rights at work Workers in NSE may lack access to freedo collective bargaining rights either for legal reas more tenuous attachment to the workplace.;N
Th violations of their fundamental rights at work, i and forced labor.;N
 Firms Firms that rely heavily on NSE need to adapt strategies from training and development of identifying the sets of skills that the firm n market.;N
An over-reliance on NSE can lead to a specific skills in the organization, limiting its changing market demand.;N
 Labor markets and society Widespread use of NSE may reinforce labor leading to a greater volatility in employment economic stability.;N
 PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK harder for workers on the new NSE to organize and to form unions.;N
Crowdworkers, for instance, are facing a challenging goal due to their geographical distribution that makes it harder to create solidarity between the workers in this particular category [60].;N
On the other side, the very spread and growth of some companies in the gig economy could make it easier for worker’s organizations to aim at them ( i.e.;N
by increasing vertical integration in some traditionally highly fragmented sectors such as car-hailing services) [62].;N
The labor movement survived recent changes in economy in two ways, and maybe these practices can be used in the future.;N
The first one involves using the same technology that is partly responsible for the creation of some of the new NSE and for the intensification of globalization to help workers organize.;N
This is already being done as shown by the following examples.;N
1 App-Based Drivers Association (ABDA) is a group from Seattle (United States) that aims to give a voice to app-based (e.g.;N
Uber, Lyft) drivers.;N
This association allows new members to join it by filling an online form on their website.;N
This group had a major win in 2015 when a law was passed by the city of Seattle allowing the car-haling app drivers to form unions [60] [62].;N
 from traditional union actors.;N
Unions can see demand economy as a members [60].;N
One cas of traditional unions wi the FairCrowdWork W created by the IG metalworkers’ union i allows workers to rate their payment with oth advisory [62].;N

With a role in educat knowledge-based w possibility is to development of int genetics, viruses [65 UPDATED With the big changes coming to work, education will need to adapt using advancements in technology to achieve this change.;N
As work becomes more and more demanding of the skilled workforce with a deep knowledge of their skills, the education system will need to train new, more specialized workers, with some forms of work ceasing to exist and new jobs emerging [44].;N
Changes in education are usually reactive: there is a tendency to continue the process of training workers to (soon-to-be) old jobs in order to serve current job market, creating a gap for the new ones.;N
The world will need to adapt to a new way of teaching so that people’s competences are not outdated and lose job opportunities [44].;N
This is a major change in how we feel about work today, when an individual study during his youth and then chooses a career that tends to be kept the same during the life.;N
In the future, we will have to keep on learning throughout life to adapt to different jobs.;N
As it can be seen, the social 4.1.;N
DO WE NEED N The increasing transforming ind models, changing t need and reduci employees’ skill se people will have different skills to s PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK requires an investment in education of years.;N
The future worker will need a different set of skills when compared to the present ones: they need more cognitive skills, such as critical thinking and non-routine problem solving, interpersonal skills, such as presentation skills and conflict resolution, and intrapersonal skills, such as adaptability and self-development [70].;N
Jobs intensive in social and creative skills have a low risk of automation [67].;N
Thus, six important skills that students can develop are: collaboration, knowledge construction, skilled communication, self-regulation, realworld problem-solving, and use of information and communication technology for learning [71].;N
The rise in the demand of highly skilled workers tends to occur simultaneously to the rise in the demand of lower level jobs, especially in services – jobs requiring low or no skills are projected to grow [69].;N
Literacy and numeracy are fundamental skills [72], and team working and communication are important skills for most jobs [69].;N

 4.3.;N
WILL SELF-EMPLOYMENT SAVE THE WORLD ?;N
The labor market has a significant presence of self-employed workers – small traders, doctors, basic manufacturers, lawyers, freelance handymen, smallholder farmers.;N
Self-employment is not only a solution for individuals who have not found such as Airbnb.;N
We trends – i.e., the depends on the e scenario of econom unemployment, the complements the w However, in a sc economic or labo collaborative econo possible option for As an agent to PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK However, it does not reduce the importance of traditional self-employment governmental programs that provide business training, technical support, and financial assistance, giving to freelancer workers a better understanding of all aspects of starting and operating a new business [84].;N
This training is an effective program for assisting unemployed workers interested in self-employment to start their own business, remain self-employed, and avoid unemployment for long periods [84].;N
 4.4.;N
WILL EVERYONE RECEIVE ADVANCED EDUCATION AND TRAINING?;N
As a part of these new, big changes, workers in the future will shift from having generalist ability to having specialist ability [44], at the higher levels of knowledge or at lower ones.;N
As technology advances, educated workers tend to benefit more and those less educated tend to have their jobs automated first [70].;N
For instance, the manufacturing industry went from craftsmanship to the factory system, changing dynamically from mechanized powered systems to the present-day trend towards application of advanced manufacturing technology (computerized design, planning, and manufacturing tools such as CAD, CAM and MRP).;N
Parallel to highlight the massive o where it is possible to large number of w outside formal educat and short-term higher like associate’s degrees difference to traditiona in the proposal: a vo focused on a rapid in market [88].;N

Servitization, Informatization, Digitalization, and Creativization will be new digital services [92].;N
Public services that provide social welfare as services for digital cities will be based on jointly resource-conscious, facilitating innovation and creativity, functioning as a service economy [93].;N
In fact, this transition from traditional models to more transparent and agile models is a symptom that covers many areas from software development to service exchanges and micro-pay according to the time you spend running a given demand.;N
In addition, the idea of creative cities is also related to an agenda and progressive planning including aspects of sustainability and social inclusion [94].;N
New productive arrangements have been tested, mainly due to the relationship functioning of lar and showing a new where creativity, c and agility are fund In the other moving to become Such organizations cultivate and trans to modify people a on the motivation insights and brains engagement [95].;N

Elderly population, as a percentage of total populati people's productive age will get larger, causing an increase in the economically active population.;N
Thus, longer lives imply changes in pension systems, as well as workers going beyond the normal retirement age for better pension.;N
The delayed retirement is a phenomenon in which elderly population keeps their labor force participation.;N
This is a recent phenomenon and is more noticeable in high-income workers and in less physically demanding occupations.;N
Workers whom delay the retirement also may delay claiming Social Security benefits [97].;N
In general, rules for eligibility to retire and claiming a pension benefit are complex and vary according to each government Bosworth et al.;N

In summary, if the trend in increase of gender equality sustains itself over the next decades, a reduction in the rate of increase of economic inequality can be expected [100].;N
Gender equality itself has been improving over the last decades but there is still a lot to be done for women rights in several countries with some critical cases as some countries in North Africa and Middle East.;N
As shown by Figure 4, the gender gap has been slowly reducing with subindexes as health and education reaching values close to 1 (equality) but the economic and system is the m growing inequality.;N

THE ECONOMY Faced with this scenario, McGahey suggests exists a path towards the introduction of a UBI as a floor to provide a basic level of subsistence as a complement to existing policies of the welfare state, or in some cases as a substitute for the welfare state [107].;N

Thinking of forms of regimes, implemented by nations, UBI would play out differently in each of these regimes, and in relation to the diverse set of existing policies in each [107].;N
In the other hand, the Institute for the 10 Future understands that Universal Basic Assets (UBA) is a fairer way of challenging inequality.;N
The UBA is a core set of resources that everyone should have, including housing, education, healthcare and financial security and has been proposed as a way to avoid economic disasters by properly assessing and distributing our resources to meet the needs of each person.;N
It can be seen as an evolution of the UBI concept, which gives each citizen a fixed amount of guaranteed Following the d a phenomenon call is predicted by so This phenomenon Gross Domestic developed countrie Today, we already activity shifting from means that dev increasing at a larg capital and people [ Countries like Indonesia and Me their GDP an ave percent per yea Indonesia are like larger in terms of PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK Figure 6.;N

Income inequality is easy to perceive in the future of automation.;N
Fewer jobs, combined with the higher skill level required for the existing ones, reduce the space for the “average worker”.;N
Also, while some countries are rapidly growing, some of them are not growing at all, increasing the gap between developed and underdeveloped countries [116].;N
Inequality has significant implications on the macroeconomic stability on 2050 as it tends to concentrate the power in the hands of the few.;N
Inequality can lead to suboptimal use of human resources, cause investment reduction, and political and economic instability [116].;N

Developing countries can find an opportunity to lead the creation of new IPs while exploiting technologies and challenges that developed countries and avoiding to commit the same mistakes of the developed countries [119].;N
The growing number of IPs in the developing countries can cause some harm too.;N
The great number of new patents and IPs can cause a scenario of choking and blocking of the technology creation [119].;N
This phenomenon, caused by low standard IPs, can be avoided by the creation of new, and more rigid standards for registering a new patent, and causing an over-protection of the IPs a country currently holds [119].;N

WILL AUTOMATION DESTROY OR ENHANCE THE E CONOMY ?;N
Technology alone will not determine economic results in terms of growth, inequality, or employment.;N
All leading economies have had access to similar levels of technology, but have had very different outcomes throughout history because they have had different institutions and policies [121].;N
Although today less than 5% of the occupations can be fully automated [14], the increasing automation will affect almost all occupations, not only factory workers and employees, but also landscaping gardeners and dental laboratory technicians, stylists, insurance sales representatives and CEOs to a greater or lesser extent.;N
Technological progress is the main driver of per capita GDP growth, allowing output to rise faster than labor and capital.;N
Increases in labor productivity generally translate into increases in average wages, giving workers the opportunity to reduce working hours and offer more goods and services [121].;N

The Academy can invest in new ways of learning and the government may create regulation for the society and markets [99].;N
Basic income is a policy that may be created by a government in order to decrease inequality – minimum wage is a common example of this type of social policy.;N
This subject is much debated among specialists in the area and is also controversial.;N
In a very short and reduced explanation, some of them, more liberal, consider that basic income and minimum wages can cause a disequilibrium in the labor market [125].;N
One of the consequences is inflation.;N
In the other point of view, minimum wages and basic income are an important public policy to reduce wage inequality and to have more equality between people.;N
Some studies consider that basic income and minimum wages can accelerate the market through stimulated aggregate demand [126].;N
 PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2 In this part, we develop three scenarios for the the optimistic, which considers the best outcome f the pessimist, which considers the worst, and the considers the trends we judged most probable.;N
 Optimistic Scenario PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 7.;N
OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO In this scenario, we present an optimistic foresight in how working will be in the year of 2050.;N
Using the trending changes identified in the Key Trends of the Future, we present our view for the next years if the best of the changes come to be.;N
 7.1.;N
AUTOMATION In this scenario we will not reach the singularity – a point where AI triggers an intelligence explosion, but on the other hand, we will absorb a strong impact on the way of processing data and information more quickly influenced by quantum computation.;N
Artificial Intelligence will be controlled by global and democratic regulations among nations to prevent their undue use as the domination of humankind by machines.;N
Artificial Intelligence will provide a scenario in 2050 of profound changes in work, replacing humans with robots and software in various areas, especially in tasks that do not use critical thinking and the accumulation of knowledge acquired by human learning experiences.;N
In this way, humans will adapt to a new reality of man-machine synergy in the More jobs opportuniti increase, which induce and investment.;N
Finally induces the production more jobs, in a virtuous With companies b more money from th workers, they can theo benefits for those work lower the prices, thes more goods with the money.;N
 Automation does human work obsolete, it, by replacing parts o we will have plausible m people deciding betwe will be ranked ac automation potential.;N
 7.2.;N
EMPLOYMENT In this scenario, bo companies will recogni workers that will lose automation and will f predictively.;N
This will a the benefits of au reduction of the co elimination of repetitive A VIEW OF keep informed of the trends in employment and use the same technology that disrupt work for their benefit.;N
Globalization will reach its most beneficial potential with workers dispersed around the world collaborating via computational tools such as augmented and virtual reality.;N
This computer-mediated work will allow people to do more homework bringing workers closer to their families and neighborhood lives and, more importantly for the globalization impact, they will not need to leave their home countries in order to find work.;N
 7.3.;N
EDUCATION education will gro STEM jobs will be future world.;N
The integration would only by grafting it o but by changing its the adaptation of th into new ones, that As this new e structured, there regularization or in However, as we ma education we still n assert that the hi remains.;N
 7.4.;N
SOCIAL WELFA We can see as a consequence of the trending changes and advancements of education, learning will be mostly selftaught, there will be easy and fast access to high quality education, alas the education will be even more specialized and knowledge-intensive generating a deep improvement in the workforce that will be more qualified.;N
With the increasing personalization of education and its importance to the new jobs needs, self-taught provides a higher adaptability to the worker.;N
Rather than In this scenario retire early and th people to spend o in their free time.;N
 Natural and preserved and exp technology, par broadens and all protected, reducing Universal Basic implemented.;N
Cou cheaper and susta PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 countries on G20 grow their GDP at an average rate of three to four percent a year and the top economies of the world change.;N
Countries like Brazil, Indonesia, India and Mexico closes their technology gap with the developed countries, increasing their GDP and creating a favorable environment for new business opportunities, allowing their population to engage on the new opportunities.;N
All this advancement in technology is extremely important for workers, as it helps them to develop and update their knowledge and skills.;N
In a world where everyone will have access to the internet, the ability to learn new things from open and free learning platforms will reduce the unemployment impact, because people will acquire new skills, mitigating the technology unemployment.;N
Thus, these technological advances will slow down the growth in inequality, the creation of new jobs and people having more free time to spend with family and to have fun.;N
In 2050, the rapid growth of the global population also starts to decrease and the population stabilizes around ten billion people.;N
With the increased population number, more cities start to appear.;N
People start to migrate from larger cities to smaller 8.1.;N
AUTOMATION In this scenario advance quicker th becoming increasingly a high unemployment see the benefits of chan workers for more pr Public policies to help this scenario will not b big portion of society ou The owners of algorithms that ca unemployment will “ow their products to the work.;N
 Therefore, new te IoT will not fulfill it because of the lack of d its costs.;N
Governments fail to realize such tec for the improvement industrial applications o of cities by the use o instance.;N
 8.2.;N
EMPLOYMENT In this scenario, technological unemploy A VIEW OF higher than in present with the increase of poverty.;N
As wars continue to be waged – mainly on the Middle East – and climate change makes few coastal regions uninhabitable.;N
Thus, immigration is expected to increase causing impacts in the places that receive these fluxes such as higher unemployment rates and lower average wages.;N
Furthermore, the intensification of the globalization of the workforce will increase immigration from poorer countries to richer ones.;N
In this scenario, the loss of jobs to foreign workers will be made easier by advances in IT, which will allow companies to hire workers from wherever they cost less.;N
Companies will not reduce working hours making some women feel that working conflicts with their interest of having children and the elderly are unable to find jobs because they need more time than young workers to take care of their health, spend time with the family and rest.;N
The reluctance of changing working hours creates a phenomenon where a small group of people works 8 or more hours while a great number of people do not have themselves despite Being harder to f conditions will mak a downward spira labor rights.;N

Most w PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 population will not receive the equal access for education and training because this advance will not achieve everybody.;N
Some people will be to continue receiving a bad education either training or none of training to adapt for change jobs rapidly.;N
Open Access initiatives will fail due its high costs, increasing the number of people unprepared for to work.;N
Besides, MOOCs will be unsuccessful for part of population because for accept this kind of platform the technology must be integrated with people and Government needs to interfere.;N
Only part of the population with a minimum technology are going to receive this accept and they will occupy the jobs, concentrating the labor with them.;N
The MOOCs such other forms to learn will not be regulated from Government, decreasing the quality of the service.;N
This unfair access to information will hamper the knowledge acquisition process and reinforce the unpreparedness for most people.;N
The knowledge-intensive jobs will be rare expensive because of this inducing the significantly difference between demand and offer.;N
This cost raise will difficult the entrance of new competitors – reinforcing the existing elite.;N

Other minorities, such afrodescendants, and immigrants, will suffer as alt-right, and supremacist movements get more support.;N
In this wave of conservative thought, LGBTI community will also see almost no advancement of their rights – and possibly some regress.;N
As countries face rising inequality, nationalist groups will increase in power and, as seen previously in history, immigrants will be pointed as responsible for all the evils in the developed countries.;N
Wars, climate change and increasing poverty will intensify immigration adding more fuel to the xenophobic movement.;N
Ideas such as Universal Basic Income and Universal Basic Assets will not gain strength and will not be applied in most countries.;N
This will only worsen the situation of the portion of society unable to find a job, which will be left to starve.;N
Part of this “extremely poor class” will not accept their situation in the economy, creating a security problem for governments as crimes rates increase.;N
Machines will have a strong role in imposing rules on the population.;N
Given the great social inequality, laws and security will be realized through machines.;N

LIKELY SCENAR PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 considering the benefits provided by automation, the government will keep an eye on the unemployment rates in order to keep it controlled while promoting economic growth.;N
The balance between automation and society demands is the key point to establish a virtuous circle in the automation expansion.;N
 services and products at the same time, a po lose their jobs, being fo ones even if not prepar and governments will measures to reduce automation to society a the economy.;N
 Governments will promote regulatory policies, in order to control the balance of the advancement in industry automation without locking it up and avoid the side effect of mass unemployment (or at least contain its fast growth).;N
Such policies will aim at protecting vulnerable people who will not be ready for this transformation.;N
In a first moment, only jobs that involve a high creativity load will remain unaffected because of the lack of technology to emulate this behavior on AI.;N
Governments and institutions will be able to contain this effect by investment and strengthening of education, with the aim of teaching new jobs in areas that will emerge.;N
Thus, governance institutions will be able to play a key role in this scenario as mediators between technology advances and people needs.;N
 Computerization reduction of low-skill Most of these p unemployment and stimulated to reduce th training their workers complete automation government will prov income.;N
This smoother fewer damages to soc keep consuming and th stable.;N
 Technologies such as IoT will continue to grow along with its demand.;N
The Communication globally as easier ac extensions and wirele cheapen the access t countries.;N
There will be between internation markets.;N
More people i will be able to work by quality of outsourcing and the prices will be A VIEW OF The government, motivated by the risk of reduction of the consumer market, will promote the flexibility of working hours, increasing the employment rate and the economic growth.;N
The medium and lowskilled workers that keep their jobs will face a reduction from the traditional 40 hours to 32 hours per week, gaining more time to use as desired.;N
This change will reduce the salaries.;N
To high-skilled workers, the flexibility will be an option considering that they will be a scarce workforce and the wage will be open to negotiation.;N
After a period of job insecurity and a series of disputes between Non-Standard forms of Employment (NSE) workers and their employees, the new types of work contracts will be better regulated in order to provide minimum rights.;N
These changes on regulation tend to improve the quality of services and reduce the conflicts between employers and employees on this job category Considering the new forms of employment, workers will not necessarily be associated to traditional trade unions as the ones we know.;N
It will take some time for these movements to be recognized by employers and by governments, but as soon as it happens, this movement will with current meth happens today, on progressively assum in this future new s Such progress in the labor market be deeper in kno adaptation to kn which are the stron again, governments helping and align th needed skills.;N
Add of education meth automation will m workload to the wo time to study and them updated opportunities in eac in the future, as learning.;N
Thus, a population will be needs of the new r the educational te not reach everybod of workers margina more qualified.;N
 Another impo influence of freedo versatility provided self-employment.;N
In PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 power to resist change, legislative power (policy makers) will be the most impacted.;N
The most radical groups will polarize the discussions in the political arena.;N
This phenomenon is a consequence of the greater dissemination of their ideas and convictions.;N
Moderates, in contrast, will be attacked from both sides and, thus, losing part of their representativeness.;N
Besides, minorities will also be able to join forces and empower themselves to confront social issues.;N
Broad dissemination of information and education will play important roles in promoting the protection of fundamental rights.;N
The role of the government will be to promote discussions on the platforms and to provide citizens with the most impartial information as possible, so that digital democracy can be put into practice.;N
In addition, it must execute, with the support and popular participation, the winning proposals.;N
With greater participation of the population in decisions, governments tend to increase the regulation of corporate actions, thus reducing the political power that large corporations have in the political arena.;N
 Another importan reduction of social in distribution of incom increased taxation t taxation in large corpo fortunes of the peopl received by the heirs, distribute wealth to society, promoting a b most vulnerable.;N
Bec impact on society, t Income should not rea and inequalities will con 9.5.;N
ECONOMY In this scenario, c China, India, Indones likely to grow their GDP to four percent per Indonesia are likely larger than the United while Pakistan and Eg Italy and Canada on Parity (PPP) basis.;N
In t year, Vietnam, India an the fastest growing eco 2050.;N
 GDP will not be t measure how fast a co itself – others indexes A VIEW OF this role.;N
The definition of new ways of working, basic income and new public policies will be decisive tasks to the government.;N
Countries that are prepared to it will succeed, the rest of them must learn how to deal with it.;N
There is not a recipe.;N
For that reason, the rules related to create new ways of employment and diversities of public policies does not apply to all countries.;N
Governments have to find ways to reinvent themselves, adapting to their specificities and building their own public policies, possible mitigating the automation effects.;N
In addition, free market may also help society.;N
There will be other ways to organize production.;N
Alternative, sharing, social, green and creative economy will become more popular.;N
Social banks will be important allies for that process.;N
They can finance these initiatives, so that is important to create new jobs, moving economy and mitigating poverty.;N
Although a worldwide-growth scenario is positive, this scenario is the one that slow down the inequality increase.;N
Inequality may be considered the gap between the richest people and the poorest people.;N
In the future, government will have an important role in this discussion.;N
It is the second, people liv migrating to urban the developed, and world will be ur shows some negat urbanization may c of cities, health ha water pollution and other hand, urb expenses on tran create cultural dive Cities will b connected.;N

Picturing presence in future re Friederike Müller-Friemauth & Eckard Minx Received: 15 June 2014 / Accepted: 30 October 2014 / Published online: 5 December 2014 # The Author(s) 2014.;N
This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract It is above all sociology and media theory which to an increasing extent are providing impulses for redefining the modern semantics of the concept of time.;N
At the focus of attention here is the explication of the present and, as an indirect consequence, a chronodiagnostically founded discrimination of the concept of future.;N
The discourse is concerned with the semantic field of simultaneity, synchronisation and above all “presentism”.;N
The background and motive of this discussion are on the one hand transformations in the modern scientific view of the world, but on the other hand new descriptions of social reality—particularly of decision-making and actions under conditions of complexity and thus of uncertainty.;N
The article deals with the question of whether this discourse, which is taking place on a number of conceptual levels predominantly within the German-speaking world, affects the interests of future research, and if so, how.;N
The authors base their investigation on practical questions developed from the point of view of organisations: What does this discussion Keywords Future research Mobility .;N

This discourse is taking plines that have invariably 47, Page 2 of 8 future research: if future research is concerned with the temporal dimension of the future and is required to provide epistemological and methodological substantiation to its statements in reference to the future, up-to-date concepts of the quality of time are highly relevant.;N
In the narrower context of future research, such activities— i.e.;N
observations of transformational trends within the core field of the discipline – are not adopted, as far as we are aware.2 It appears to us worthwhile and imperative to remedy this state of affairs.;N
In doing so, our perspective is related to organisations, which efforts in foresight activities (“detecting the future”, i.e.;N
by means of monitoring and scanning) with increasing frequency hit the wall.;N
Results are going to be contingent and require explanations (why detecting this weak signal and not that?).;N
In addition to it the quantity of signals explode.;N
The rising complexity of the settings in which organisations act and decide face them with so far unsolved methodological challenges.;N
We ask if the debate about presentism is able to help putting this dramatised perception of the issue into proper proportion, possibly illustrating not a short cut, but something along the lines of a clarifying, inspiring perspective at least.;N
Whether this above all sociologically conducted parallel discourse concerning the transformation of the current concept of time can be rendered fruitful to the interests of future research – and if so, how – is the subject of this paper.;N
At the outset, we give a cursory presentation of central positions of this new version of an up-to-date understanding of the future and summarise the requirements that can thereby be deduced for dealing with the future (I).;N
Subsequently we expose the specific features, which are central (II).;N
Finally, we discuss possible consequences for a future research in organisations that methodically places the condition and the transformation of its very own object area – a constantly updated concept of the semantics of time – at the centre of its attention (III).;N

What is “presentism”?;N

In any case, somet premise only gains analytica with a signature of the z contended with numerous p and – as a result – with s Eur J Futures Res (2014) 2:47 present or the past.;N
How it eventuates is determined by what is selected as being significant today and is further pursued – in other words by how decisions are made.;N
Time thus “shrinks” to the dimension of the present, it “contracts”.5 This situation gives rise to several consequences, including a fundamental dilemma: since a variety of problematic situations arose from the dynamics of past developments that proved basically insoluble (such as the German “energy turnaround”), the pressure of decision-making swells like an immense wave and increasingly reinforces the necessity of future-proof solutions.;N
It is such implications of an “extended present” that fuel the debate concerning “presentism”.;N
What does this mean for future research?;N
Attention is initially drawn to everything that increases the quality of decisions currently under discussion.;N
In an “extended present”, future research is increasingly transformed into an evaluation technique: the future is essentially dependent on the way in which something new is identified and ordered.;N
It is concerned both with discarding irrelevant terms from the complex of simultaneity and with selecting something that is specific, important, complex, insecure, is not yet in existence or only appears diffuse.;N
This intelligent modularisation of possibilities is becoming the core competence of future research.;N
In any case, the focus is no longer on the intrinsic value of what is new, of what is yet to be: the future.;N
Is future research thus possibly losing its grip on its entire field of investigation?;N
No – but it is undergoing significant transformation.;N
In the light of entrepreneurial focus, this means for example: future research is becoming more and more an auxiliary discipline for entrepreneurial decision-making.;N
Under conditions of high complexity, it combines existing know-how and knowledge with future hypotheses – in the mode of the present: if what lies in front of us no longer offers focus on the future and inc metier is the synchronisati points of departure or spr example, with “good” hypo alone in view of rapidly in longer yields a valid basis Peculiarities of presentism In schematical terms, the presentism means: Not look row but exploring occuren terms, future research pro domain of combinatorial p then utilise to arrive at a d broad assumptions: if you d you will have the chance of impose methodical checks o For practitioner in org makers – this new focus o control and securing is inter come under fire for some t sations are arranged in a views (participative manag organized units and so forth presentism is fascinating be thought patterns: It might b date provisional thinking modifies the understanding fundamentally – and in ma 1.;N
Primacy of simultaneit put things into relation One can neither know 47, Page 4 of 8 what are the opportunities, the risks, the dangers?;N
Luhmann speaks in this connection of “synchronisation” or “time binding”.;N
This is concerned with mind games, with provisional thinking, which sets out to render time in convenient forms.8 Behind this concept are fundamental assumptions relating to future research that cannot be discussed here in detail.;N
Basically, we are dealing here with the generation of alternative future-related bottleneck strategies between the three poles of consensus, object and time.;N
The dimension of time is consistently privileged here over the objective and social dimensions.;N
Exactly this is not only the focus of presentims, but also the assignment of future research.;N
Chance–risk analyses, for example, are already being worked on by the economic sciences, and problems of decision-making or arriving at a consensus by sociology and social psychology, and so on.;N
Future research supports decisions made under conditions of high uncertainty – from the viewpoint of presentism – by temporalising the conditions for decision-making: this is “time binding”.;N
In organisations, for example, it installs appropriate time regimes that structure, but also impose limits on, systems of values.;N
What differentiates it from other influences on decisions made in conditions of uncertainty, for example on the part of the economic sciences, is the concentrated modularisation of temporality: what will happen when, what could happen when, what is not likely to happen?;N
This methodical, “temporalising” reflection loop is a safeguarding mode – in a decidedly temporal dimension.;N
It endeavours to control self-created (imagined) options in contrast to that which is known for certain [17], only then do other disciplinary expertises follow.;N

One methodical possibility of doing this is to think more intensively than usual in variable temporal structures, using scenario techniques: playing at different innovational tempi in the organisations (not with supposedly weak or strong dynamics of trends!), with one’s own formative levers in the sense of “accelerators” or “retarders” (not “drivers” or “preventers”!) and so on.;N
Here too, it is necessary to consistently privilege the dimension of time.;N
This list is incomplete – it is more of an initial outline than an exhaustive register.;N
A rough profile of this modernised future research is nevertheless already discernible.;N
 Future research: a profession for “time binding” The debate surrounding presentism brings up methodological idiosyncrasies associated with future research that have gone previously unnoticed.;N
The significance of these idiosyncrasies to future research moving forward must be discussed and assessed.;N
Investigating the future & & & & by assessing simultaneously occurring events against and comparing them with one another instead of looking to tomorrow, which, due to the fundamental unpredictability of the future, limits us to “simple” projection, as opposed to actual forecasting, in such a way that circumstantial information is, due to its excessive complexity, predominantly subject to radical filtering, yet can also be enriched by further monitoring in exceptional cases, using patterns of legitimation whereby future-related decisions are no longer justified by events (past, present or If one aims to use the de structively, it is possible to c for this distinctive approac this using seven theses an ideas from certain aspects o Future research has a conce are under-determined We must begin by clarifyi future research concepts its concept of time must be contemporary and somewh theory.;N

 47, Page 6 of 8 Presentism illuminates a fundamental question relating to future research that has, until now, remained largely unanswered: what is it responsible for?;N
For not being misread: This question we do not mean objectively, “topically”.;N
From a practical – more precise: praxeological - point of view, future research can be seen as being founded on 1 of at least 2 perspectives.;N
Future research may be responsible for all conceivable factual and social (social, economic, political, technological etc.) problems but only with a view to tomorrow.;N
How will the ecological situation develop?;N
What customer groups will form in India?;N
What does 3D printing mean for private households?;N
From this perspective, future researcher are no more than consultants - corporate advisors, technology managers, innovation experts or social researchers with an eye for the new, for emerging trends and for unusual evolutionary paths.;N
Topical experts with a penchant for scouting.;N
Alternatively, future research may be genuinely founded on its field of expertise and the analytical dimension of time consistently prioritised.;N
This would make the field a form of expertise for leap in time of a completely different type, for questions such as: How can we use past experience (directly or in a revised form)?;N
How can we shape current events to work in our favour?;N
How can we help to make a specific development path that is more or less preferable to us more or less probable?;N
What type of innovation would be required in order to make a specific circumstance x at all logically plausible in y years?;N
So far, the core source of expertise for these types of questions has been therapists and psychologists, or mystics, clairvoyants and gurus.;N
This tradition was founded by the ancient Oracle of Delphi, traces of whose prophecies can still be seen in modern future research.;N
Is it possible to use another: modern and scientific basis to alter future circumstances Presentism calls into questi methods of future research forecasting, backcasting, pr what-if-frames etc.) to the m takes sides, praising (i.e.;N

What does “good” even mean in this context?;N
How is it qualified?;N
What makes this type of decision special: What “can it do” particularly well, or at least better than others?;N
According to presentism, the only available answers are: “Good” does not mean reclaiming a leap in knowledge for tomorrow (this is logically impossible), be this for reasons of authority (guru positioning), methodology (having the best algorithm, monitoring system etc.) or technology (being first to market, “newism”, the next big thing etc.).;N
“Good” also cannot mean: safe, optimal, best-case.;N
It can only ever be a preferred suggestion under these precise, specific, situational conditions.;N
Furthermore, this type of decision is “special” not because of its hip, modern methods or the cool image of its protagonists, but because of its specific position in relation to a reality that is constantly and unavoidably changing in modern times.;N
This last point is the most delicate - it affects key fundamental aspects of the way we understand (organisational) practice.;N
Presentism highlights how important the present is for future research This is also not a new concept in the field of future research.;N
Nevertheless, it would be counter-intuitive to make it the centre of future research: presentism attempts paradoxically to “lock” the future.;N
It implores us to think not of “all that is possible”, but primarily of that which can be influenced.;N
(This is why all monitoring of the environment tends to be seen as futile in this way of thinking).;N
The path is being systematically diverted towards a varied “multi-optionism”- or that is the claim, at least.;N
For practitioners of future provision, this is an extremely interesting message: it seems to illuminate a path upon which excessive circumstantial complexity could be solved “internally”.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract From January 2011 until April 2013, the Enquete Commission “Growth, Prosperity, Quality of Life”, a political body appointed by the German parliament and consisting of 17 experts and 17 MPs, analysed aspects of a sustainable economy and new indicators of prosperity.;N
Based on an analysis of the commission’s texts, the article shows that (A) the quality of the commission’s work is very heterogeneous from a futures studies point of view.;N
This is exemplified by an analysis of the way the commission members perceive characteristics of the future.;N
Nevertheless, the article argues that (B) the transparent dissent visible in the commission’s texts can shed new light on the discussion of objectivity in futures studies.;N
Self-reflexive research which strives for a diverse and transdisciplinary structure—as can be observed in the Enquete Commission -, may lead to better results.;N
In the conclusion, the benefits, but also the dangers of such new perspectives in research are discussed.;N

Its work may be placed in the context of reflexive modernity, in which modern society and academia need to face and handle the risks they themselves have created and criticise them [5, 6].;N
One of these now independent processes of modernisation is the apparent dependency of modern society on economic growth with all its ecological, political and social consequences [7].;N
This problem was already pointed out in 1972 by the Club of Rome report “Limits to Growth” [8].;N
Since then, the dominant acceptance of an inherent need for growth has been criticised widely [7, 9].;N
In response to this criticism, the German parliament as a political actor established an Enquete Commission, which had the explicit mission to challenge the growth paradigm: a remarkable act of self-reflection.;N
A majority of parliamentary groups supported the motion that called upon the Bundestag to appoint an Enquete Commission “Growth, Prosperity and Quality of Life—Paths to Sustainable Economic Activity and Social Progress in the Social Market Economy” (…).;N
The Enquete Commission aims to advance the programmatic examination of Germany’s well-being prospects for the coming decades, of our understanding of prosperity and well being and of the principles that may help us to meet the economic, social and ecological challenges [10].;N
The Enquete Commission (in German: EnqueteKommission “Wachstum, Wohlstand, Lebensqualität”—Wege zu nachhaltigem Wirtschaften und gesellschaftlichem Fortschritt in der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft) consisted of 17 experts and 17 MPs of the following political parties: 6 MPs from the conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary group, 4 from the Social Democrats (SPD), 3 from the Liberals (FDP), 2 from the Left Party and 2 from the environmentalist Green party.;N

 Materials and methods This article is based on the to the future that does not h Eur J Futures Res (2015) 3:58 Part (B) of the analysis is an attempt to improve futures studies by highlighting certain problematic aspects of objectivity vs.;N
subjectivity, which the Enquete Commission, as a political body, has dealt with differently than futures studies generally has.;N
The analysis traces the conflicts and different perspectives that are reflected in the texts produced by the commission.;N
The results and the opportunities they offer are then examined in three lines of argument called subjectivity, diversity and transdisciplinarity.;N
The article is thus a qualitative and theoretical exploration that aims to encourage futurists to critically examine their own perspectives and methods as well as the impact of futures studies on other spheres such as politics.;N
 Assumptions about the nature of the future As any other researcher, futurists work on the basis of certain fundamental assumptions, in this case assumptions about the nature of the future.;N
Making these assumptions explicit is a productive approach, since “each assumption contributes both to the conduct of futures studies as most futurists understand the aims of the field and to the intellectual products that futurists create” [20].;N
The following list is a compilation of fundamental assumptions and views collected by a number of futurists over time: (a) Things are different in the future than they are today [20].;N
(b) All relevant things (such as laws of nature and human nature) do not change [21].;N
(c) The future is predetermined [22, 23].;N
(d) The future is open [24].;N
(e) The future can be influenced [20].;N

Re and the dangers of extrapo preferred futures figure pro in connection with time ho It may be carefully con futures studies, such as un futures, have successfully d 58, Page 4 of 8 emphasised the influence of power relations on the research process and questioned the assumption that academics and scientists can reach value-neutral insight at all.;N
The results of their research process are not only affected by external pressure (for instance, in commissioned studies), but even more so by “the fundamental interest that first and foremost constitutes science” [34, 35].;N
According to Habermas, the strive to liberate themselves from outside interests makes researchers even less aware of the inner interest driving their activity [36].;N
Neither do they realise how their positions in society and social structures affect their statements—Bourdieu has therefore claimed that they have a blind spot with respect to their own position [37].;N
Feminist critics identified many aspects of research results in social studies, but also science that were influenced by the researchers’ gender and in particular by the one-sided focus on the male perspective.;N
Harding mentions as examples a generalisation of the traditional male dichotomy of “labour” and “leisure” that cannot easily be applied to traditionally female reproductive work [38].;N
Schiebinger provides many examples of how gender influences science with respect to research priorities, structures, language and criteria determining whether an investigation is even counted as scientific [39].;N
Lastly, academia is also criticised for its eurocentrism which prevents a complex world view—Said summarises the problems of objectivity when he points out the “highly if obscurely organized political circumstances obtaining when knowledge is produced” [40].;N
The objectivity discussion is mirrored in the futures studies discourse.;N
Bell states that “there is precious little value-free science” [41].;N
As an example, Hideg identifies the belief in rational decision-making as a limiting influence on futures studies today and demands: “If studies of futures constitute a science, it must make values explicit, i.e.;N
it must present possible futures together with their value content.” [42].;N

In research projects, a lack of diversity in the research team is not usually called out and even more rarely corrected [47].;N
It is more than an ethical problem, if, for example, perspectives of women or people of colour are not considered.;N
Futures studies in particular needs diversity, as it requires and fosters thinking “outside the box” [50] and thus helps find new paths [42].;N
As the introduction to this section has shown, science and its protagonists are often merely assumed to be objective without their possible one-sided perspectives being challenged in public.;N
In the Enquete Commission as a political body, however, the lack of diversity was a subject of public criticism.;N
This mainly concerned the members’ gender: in the beginning, there was not one woman expert among the 17 experts appointed by the parliamentary groups [11].;N
This was criticised by the media and individual initiatives as refraining from gender competency and ignoring female expertise [51].;N
This expertise and also the experience of women are considered indispensable, especially on issues of prosperity, wellbeing and the concept of labour [31].;N
Even though at times the group of MPs included 10 women, the results of the commission can still be considered less valuable, since apparently all political parties, even more left-wing ones, trusted men more when it came to expertise on issues such as prosperity and quality of life.;N
Due to the criticism voiced in public, the experts leaving the commission were replaced by three women experts during the working period of the Enquete Commission [11].;N
This is, however, not nearly as much as was demanded by critical citizens and in a motion by over 100 women MPs [51, 52].;N

cerned with the relationship In a technocratic model that politicians more or l 58, Page 6 of 8 MPs will, after all, participate in future lawmaking and have, as Bell has pointed out, more chances than other individuals to influence the future [20].;N
The experts in the Enquete Commission provide factual knowledge, the MPs, on the other hand, provide knowledge related to political procedures and the positions of parties and parliamentary groups (including their negotiability).;N
During the work of the commission, these two types of knowledge are put into relation.;N
Thus, the Enquete Commission’s texts include information on the connection of scientific and academic statements, research results, recommendations, etc.;N
with party positions and the plausibility of implementation.;N
This is of special interest to futures studies, since the way individuals act and decide is extremely difficult to model or foresee.;N
Futures studies also values transdisciplinary research, which tries to activate and integrate knowledge coming from outside academia and, like the Enquete Commission, bases its work process on problems defined by practitioners [15].;N
The proposed value that MPs’ positions may have for futures studies is exemplified in the number of futureoriented recommendations for action included in the final report.;N
They are often connected to individual parliamentary groups -see the minority votes of the Green party and the Left party who both propose an alternative indicator of prosperity [11].;N
Recommendations for action presented in such a way are “possible futures together with their value content” as demanded by Hideg [42].;N
This view may be challenged by the question of whether existing election manifestos of political parties offer the same sort of information.;N
This depends on the topic.;N
Election manifestos have been shown to remain much more general with respect to growth, sufficiency and other topics that have been treated with a much more critical approach in the commission [57].;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract This article stems from the impression of being condemned to late and moralizing reactions in regard to advances in the life sciences.;N
We suggest a return to a speculative and theoretical approach in posing the question(s) of the limit of possible thinking of the enhanced human.;N
This return allows for the possibility to show, not just inductively, but “clearly and distinctly,” the specific justifications and lines of reasoning of anthropocentric prejudice or species narcissism.;N
It also enables us to move freely and precisely along the limits of thinking the human/non-human.;N
In this way, we hope to put forward a few markers or guideposts that would further the debate about notions of human enhancement.;N
 This article is the result of the work on the project Rare Diseases: Molecular Pathophysiology, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Modalities, and Social, Ethical, and Legal Aspects (project number 41004), the subproject of the Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory Bioethical Aspects: Morally Acceptable Within the Biotechnologically and Socially Possible”, as well as the project Studying Climate Change and its Influence on the Environment: Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation (project number 43007), the subproject Keywords Conceptions of metamorphosis .;N

In our attempt to test if and to what extent it is morally acceptable for modern people to use biotechnologies in order to enhance their cognitive, morphological and procreative capacities, we will mainly rely on the division regarding specific patterns of means of enhancement.;N
Namely, we will try to connect this division with the figures of the “enhanced” that is with the images of a creature inscribed with a feature that, from its very beginning, and exactly as a human, he/she wants to be, such as Übermensch [6], Homo superior [7] More than human [8].;N
We could say that our paper is an attempt to follow the development of modes of enhancement through already established sciences.;N
“Human biology” was first affected by means of chemistry, then of physics and lastly by means of biology itself.;N
This encroachment of science of life upon life seems to lead to unsuspected and spooky consequences.;N
We see an image of a human being which is not even the offensive vitiation of its “natural” self any longer.;N
Rather, due to the enhancements that have already dissolved its consistency, making it no longer recognizably human (even in aberration), it is no longer affected, nor therefore determined, by the enhancement, making it a vision of something non-human that cannot be further enhanced.;N
The question, however, remains: has “human biology” thus finally been surpassed and has the illusion of its privileged exclusiveness been abandoned?;N
Or, on the contrary, has it just been regenerated and affirmed with regard to the “assigned” and not the “given” element of “perfectibility” in its structure?;N
The historical path we sketch, and the continuity we establish, can also be read as a gradual, astonishing (or farcical) development in executing the belief of humanism that the human is special precisely and entirely because it can become anything it chooses to become.;N
 It gives you wings: the case of chemistry oldest hope of mankind,” a historical motif, which pers tific projects, such as disco that sense, the “scientific” u extends the same line of hu may be as “authentic” as b does this in a qualitatively There is something tha modern advocates of enhan mists or one of the heroes who is searching for the pla the difference is, indeed, in t to find the “perfect nature” [ in the animized and diviniz any kind of tool, which wou produced without a devote There is, of course, such a th aimed – as it is today, only w removing pathologies that e an individual's functioning be “statistically normal” for structure of the body itself 12].;N

If we take a look at the pharmacology of Stevenson's Dr.;N
Jekyll, we notice it lacks any physical detail, but has abundant oracular references to a mysterious salt [14].;N
The scenes of Sherlock Holmes's shrewd illumination or the atmosphere of opium vapors with the creativity of doomed poets coming up are also veiled by mystery and painted in sfumato.;N
The process of creation in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein [15] is presented in a similar manner – without any details – as it is in the films The Golem , Metropolis, Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein [16, 17].;N
Physical artifacts of “science,” all pieces of equipment, all experiments, laboratories, narcotics, rays and similar tools are presented, as a rule, “ambiguously, illogically, and mysteriously, in other words, irrationally.” They are linked together incoherently and are justified no better than “material junk of alchemists,” if at all [13, 18].;N
Still, the conviction remains: science can – perhaps at too costly a price – make a better being.;N
Now, aside from the undivided and epoch-determined image of metamorphosis, and despite the (partly secret) science-induced, frightening vision of re- or de-generation, the novella features a particular vision of enhancement techniques.;N
It is noteworthy that Dr Jekyll is always present in his experiments on humans.;N
Even when he changes into Mr.;N
Hyde, the change is always transitory and reversible.;N
Not only that, but Dr Jekyll functions as an identity anchor from which Mr.;N
Hyde departs.;N
In that sense, the reader always keeps in mind the true identity of the character (Dr Jekyll), and considers the other a temporary aberration (Mr.;N
Hyde).;N

Therefore it seems that cyborgs of popular science fiction are created in advance to imitate human life but remain outside of it, and thus serve as a counterbalance to humanity, one which emphasizes human desirability.;N
They are “marking the boundaries of humanness … against technology” [24, 25].;N
This is an old paradigm, bordering on cliché, in which characters ranging from Baum's Tin Man to the Terminator nostalgically and mournfully celebrate a humanity which they resemble closely but to which they do not belong.;N
[26].;N
In that sense, the image of a cyborg which we find in popular culture perfectly illustrates deep-seated countertechnological assumptions of humanity.;N
But is perfectibility not at the very core of human existence?;N
Is betterment not actually something fundamentally human, even if we use unconventional means to achieve it?;N
If we agree that our evolution is desirable and finally at hand, why discredit in advance any type of enhancement?;N
Visions of our cybernetic future are in that sense absolutely compatible with our emancipatory intention to attain directed evolution that would be informed by our scientific knowledge.;N
J.;N
B.;N
S Haldane and John Bernal [27] where among the first authors to see that science can become one of the causal powers that purposefully directs the otherwise slow and contingent process of Darwinian evolution.4 What underlies the notion of the cyborg is the idea that science can provide some kind of “clean slate” or cleared space for a radical change of humans and their future [28].;N
Moreover, the future has already begun.;N
We have suddenly found out that we ourselves are cyborgs – mechanized constellations that have abandoned, although refuse to admit so, the ancient determinant of unique embodiment, personality and subjectivity.;N
As of not long ago, but certainly for some time, we have been “post-human”: physically and/or mentally was the invention of electro we have been noticing simi beings and computer system traditional Western ideas of direction toward cyborgs, taken.;N
And while some peo and can hardly wait for the others shudder at the thoug out of the very machines tha words, a change without which seems to be endan and lawful way: the appear the next evolutionary stage, at best, “out-of-date.” If th information, it is only a m chines replace us as our decide to fight them or jo ourselves, the days of the h However, the key and p far-reaching moment in the of man is certainly the est (cultural) cyborg's status in to,” written by Donna Har lutely affirms the influence concludes that the very ima of the maze of dualisms bodies and our tools to our istic, as a place that incorp material surrounding, the cy dualistic strategy of identity and female, people and bea cyborg lends its image to like to depose the universal [32].;N
Thus the cyborg has th modern human identity, no that identity but also to enc Eur J Futures Res (2013) 1:21 With the cyborg metaphor, the exoticized non-biological body of “cyberfeminism” substitutes the carnal body of classical feminist theory: cyborgs are not born of a woman, they cannot reproduce, but they break all blood, racial, species or population ties in the most insidious way [34].;N
 Lost case: biology After theoretical investment in emancipation by cyborg (whose posthumanity, disembodied, deprived of complexity, bloodless, without family ties, turns out to be ominously curative of human awkwardness), provided that we outlive chemical and technical intervention and influence, we are left with the biotic attempts at human alteration.;N
There are genetic mutations, clones and even something (perhaps most) horrible: a complete decomposition and amorphization – for the sake of the possibility of a formless existence.;N
Our resistance to biological remodeling of life is probably fiercer than to episodes of poison induced mania or systematic poisoning by steroids, fiercer even than the technophobic resistance to numerous implants and prostheses we eventually “get used to.” Even though what we consider the limit of the human has been stretched through intoxication or technology, and is now difficult to define or establish, we are still anxious about gene manipulation.;N
Genetic alteration is still placed automatically and unconditionally beyond the acceptable limit, even dealing with soy DNA, no less its human counterpart.;N
“The chemical or physical inventor is always a Prometheus”.;N
In pointing out a new kind of unprecedented insult, Haldane said, nearly a century ago, that there is no great invention, from fire to flying, which has not been “hailed as an insult to some god”.;N
But if every physical and chemical invention is a blasphemy, every biological invention is a “perversion”.;N
Invariably, an observer of a culture alien to any such novelty would perceive the invention as indecent and unnatural [35].;N

They are the only biological organisms in the Star Trek universe that can be whatever they want: various “solid” forms of life, but also a fire, fog, inanimate objects, operational computer devices, light reflections, etc.;N
In their “natural” state, they are – a familiar picture indeed – some kind of rippling liquid collective life form, a manifold united into an ocean of calm waves, a biological orbifold.;N
They have a faint feeling of individual identity and like to think of themselves as a drop in the “Great Link,” a direct and overall connectedness with the life of their species, in which they are united.;N
Changelings appear as pure protobiological mixture, a (more) dense (compared to Proteus) liquid or gelatinous mass, whose appearance is as ancient as life itself and a fundamental element of its composition.;N
It seems as though Changelings represent the final frontier of both the human and its vision of enhancement, the frontier of thinkability of the enhanced human where it still remains human.;N
But at the same time, it looks as though the contemporary “enhancement movement” has done nothing more than taken both humanists and transhumanists seriously by radicalizing the fears of the first and hopes of the second.;N

Those promises leads us back, in a way threatening to all traditional (sup)positions – this time with full awareness of the consequences of transhumanism – to the initial question of the entire humanist project.6 Let us take seriously Pico della Mirandola's notion of the human [43, 44] as a “creature of indeterminate image” and as “the free and extraordinary shaper” of his own image, placed by God outside the world so that it could “fashion” itself in the form it preferred.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract An extensive literature deals with the socio-political and electoral factors that inspire and explain far right party development.;N
Very often in this discussion, far right parties (FRPs) are hypothesised as independent entities that do not have an influence on - or are influenced by - other far right parties.;N
This critical reflection challenges that assumption and suggests that trans-national diffusion patterns between far right parties are not only underdeveloped in existing explanations of far right development, but are also critical for an improved and more complete understanding of the far right party phenomenon as a whole.;N
In an initial discussion of diffusion, this particular article emphasises its prominence as an explanatory factor of far party development and reflects in more detail upon its role, extent and scope.;N
On a more normative note, a more comprehensive and accurate explanatory model of far right party development could prove to be useful to anticipate future societal evolutions and political developments.;N

This critical reflection seeks to clarify and elaborate the enigmatic nature of these questions.;N
It also advocates for a more detailed analysis of the dynamic FRP network, irrespective of the fact that the study of interdependence is relatively uncommon in party politics and largely absent from FRP research.;N
Furthermore, and based on those initial arguments, this critical reflection recognises the role of interdependence and argues for its inclusion in the explanatory framework of FRP development.;N
These theoretical arguments are supported by a number of empirical illustrations.;N
 The broader literature: Interdependence as a systematic hypothesis In the academic literature, the study of interdependence is quite extensive and embraces a widespread application2.;N
The Treaty of Westphalia (1648) resulted in the European-wide dispersion of the territorially bounded nation-state [40].;N
Participatory democracy finds its initial foundation in the French Revolution [9].;N
The third wave of democracy globalised the Carnation revolution in Portugal [30].;N
In the United States, political communication experienced a paradigm shift, which subsequently spread to and throughout most of the Western world [55].;N
Since the 1980s, regulatory capitalism has been gradually spreading from North to South [43].;N
The dynamics that describe these different expressions of interdependence comprise the dissemination of a specific object between socio-political entities or contexts, at a particular time and via a variety of networks.;N
The theorisation and inclusion of these dynamics can add validity and precision to some of the broader, yet more rigid and spatially limited explanatory frame- 1968.;N

In addition, the term FRP represents simplicity and is relatively uncomplicated, which the current literature often undervalues.;N
Its conceptualisation is based on three broad criteria: a spatial, an attitudinal and a systemic criterion.;N
The spatial criterion refers to the party’s positioning to the right of (most) traditional parties, but to the left of undemocratic and anti-system parties.;N
Since the position of each party changes through time and between sociopolitical contexts through their dependency on demand side factors, supply side factors and the interaction with other parties, it is difficult to standardise this relative distance.;N
Two additional principles contribute to a more exact conceptual placement of FRPs.;N
On one hand, an attitudinal component describes the core political values FRPs propose, most crucially in the form of nationalism, xenophobia, and authoritarianism.;N
On the other hand, a systemic component describes how and to what extent FRPs oppose the ambitions of the societal system and its principal agents (i.e.;N
traditional parties and existing elites).;N
This notion of goal differentiation to criticise, yet remain loyal to the existing system can be described by another core characteristic of FRPs, namely populism [73].;N
Implicitly or explicitly, most research assumes FRPs to be independent from one another, particularly throughout their life cycle.;N
On one hand, the assumption of FRP independence facilitates the composition of separate cause-and-effect models of FRP development.;N
Often, the literature either perceives FRPs as inward-looking and highly conservative agents, or it discerns (developmental) similarities as independent responses to common or similar challenges, without any sort of interdependent process or influence between FRPs [3].;N
On the other hand, some analyses do allow FRPs to be interdependent entities and for their development to be an interdependent process, yet most of those studies do not scrutinise such a stipulation any further [52].;N
In those cases, the specification of interdependence takes the form of an as commonly assumed.;N

More specifica 54, Page 4 of 10 in their developmental trajectories7.;N
Within each wave, the specific dynamics that explain a trend between agents are more complex than shared responses to external circumstances (i.e.;N
demand side factors) or coincidence.;N
Hence, it is essential to expand the scope of the existing framework that describes the development of an FRP within such a wave.;N
The incongruence between existing theorisations and assumptions on one side and pragmatic and empirical observations on the other provide an initial signal that the structural independence hypothesis and the present accounts of FRP development should be revisited.;N
The independent analysis of FRPs is not accurate, nor realistic and ignores certain conditionalities and external dependencies (cf.;N
Galton’s problem)8.;N
Most often, this dilemma is simply ignored [8] or neglected [14] so one does not have to deal with the potential difficulties it brings (e.g.;N
correlated error terms, biased standard errors).;N
To the best of the author’s knowledge and abilities, only three existing studies take into account the potential interdependence between FRPs.;N
Husbands recognises that FRP support levels appear in waves - confirming von Beyme’s original contention and are partially caused by ‘contagion’ [31].;N
DeClair models explicit trans-national links between the far right’s mother party the FN - and other FRPs [15].;N
Thus far, Rydgren has published the most comprehensive effort.;N
He proposes the inclusion of FRP interdependence upon explaining their emergence and he does so by referring to these dynamics as patterns of diffusion [60].;N
These existing research efforts are admirable and serve as initial incentives to go further and resume scientific developments.;N
This critical reflection contributes to the debate by providing an indication of the unlikely nature of the independence hypothesis, and aspires to stimulate future research to explicitly and formally incorporate interdependence between FRPs as part of the explanation of FRP development.;N
In an effort to analyse FRP development more accurately and comprehensively, this study proposes that any and all analytical accounts of FRP development should not be restricted to the are linked both to external ch other by mean of both a struc of values, or culture” [38, p.7 diffusion.;N

Hedstrøm and Swedberg suggest social mechanisms - like diffusion - can cover the middle ground between social laws and description by stipulating a systematic account of how cause-and-effect are linked to one another [29]10.;N
An important advantage of this approach is the ability to provide a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional account of a phenomenon by the analysis of how a (causal) relationship is constructed.;N
In short, this critical reflection suggests future research should examine the validity and complexity of trans-national diffusion patterns between FRPs by going beyond simple cause-and-effect models and by including social mechanisms as an important construct of the explanatory framework of FRP development.;N
Some of the existing explanatory frameworks of FRP development are restricted in their scope to either the explanation of FRP similarities (demand side) or some of their more prevalent differences (supply side).;N
Only on rare occasions are both approaches combined and are frameworks able to explain patterns of variance, i.e.;N
both similarities and differences.;N
The integration of trans-national diffusion as a social and explanatory mechanism would not only complement the more structural and variable-oriented accounts of FRP development, but it would also provide a more comprehensive (explaining both similarities and differences) and dynamic (including processes in addition to variables) explanatory framework of FRP development.;N
 Trans-national diffusion patterns between FRPs This paper suggests that the existence of trans-national diffusion patterns between FRPs, notably as part of their developmental process, is more likely than typically assumed through- FRPs and give a primary dynamics play in the FRP As already indicated, it recent expression of right-w it part of a larger cycle-like would be highly unlikely t neous expression of right-w independent) and do not sh or collective origins.;N

S 54, Page 6 of 10 Western Europe.;N
Not only does this stimulate the recognition of trans-national diffusion between FRPs, it also validates the relevance of these dynamics as part of FRP development.;N
Given the overall identification of diffusion patterns, it is then possible to further stipulate the specificities of this process.;N
Since patterns of diffusion are - by definition - spatially and temporally heterogeneous, the roles as transmitter and adopter are not necessarily fixed throughout an FRP’s development.;N
Furthermore, it is necessary to make three specifications regarding the role of FRPs throughout the diffusion process.;N
First, whereas a transmitter can be passive, an adopter cannot, which implies adoption (the receiving process of diffusion) is always conscious and perceived desirable (i.e.;N
utilitymaximising).;N
Second, the social distance between FRPs plays an important role in the diffusion process.;N
Specifically, it is possible to hypothesise that a provision of social proximity between FRPs not only facilitates (i.e.;N
optimises) diffusion, but also is necessary for it to be persistent.;N
Third, upon adoption, an FRP serves best to properly align the object of diffusion to its socio-political context so as to increase its likelihood of direct success.;N
The two most prevalent courses of frame alignment in an FRP context are frame bridging and frame amplification.;N
Frame bridging allows an FRP to link previously unconnected master frame components so as to expand its potential audience.;N
Often times, FRPs divide the electorate in two antagonistic groups with their dualistic frames.;N
Nationalism does this by creating those within and outside the nation.;N
Populism differentiates between ‘the people’ and the ‘elite’.;N
Authoritarianism differs between those who submit to and those who reject authority.;N
Xenophobia emphasises fear of ‘the other’.;N
In this context, it is advantageous for FRPs to generate overlap between several of these antagonistic categories, thereby bridging different audiences.;N
Frame amplification indicates that certain master frame components take priority over others.;N
Because these components are often directly and most adopt a new master frame i interpretation of other FRP effect on the diffusion pro trated by changes in the r associated with a new ma diffusion literature, it is po mechanisms most promine fusion between FRPs: Emu The former does not require latter does.;N

 Eur J Futures Res (2014) 2:54 conducted with high-ranking party officials and 22 with nonpolitical, yet prominent functionaries.;N
Without committing to an exhaustive and overly detailed analysis, it is possible to draw some broader conclusions from this data collection process.;N
Most importantly, all interviewees - without exception - recognise the importance of other FRPs in their development, as well as the explicit and often formal attention they give to the developments of FRPs in other countries.;N
It also appears this attention is mostly positive, as successful FRPs are extensively highlighted, while some of the more cautious tales often remain silent or even undisclosed.;N
Even though trans-national diffusion is overly present throughout the FRP history, it also appears to be closely linked to individuals, and perhaps even the interpersonal skills of some of the high-ranking FRP officials.;N
In support of this critical reflection’s proposed importance of trans-national diffusion as an explanatory dynamic of FRP development, it was also properly recognised that in addition to diffusion’s more restricted interpretation as a between-FRP dynamic, its wider interpretation also plays an important role in FRP development.;N
The diffusion patterns with other domestic parties, as well as with both more traditional and more extreme parties in further-away contexts, are typically also identified as contributing factors to the FRP development.;N
Based on the policy diffusion literature, it is possible to theorise learning as a more complete and all-encompassing mechanism, with particular benefits for an agent’s long-term development.;N
In an FRP context, this hypothesis can be initially substantiated by empirical evidence.;N
FRPs that have used learning mechanisms and interpersonal channels as a foundation of their trans-national diffusion dynamics all seem to have experienced successful emergence.;N
Those that systematically continue to do this after their emergence appear to have consolidated and develop into successful political parties (e.g.;N
FN, VB, SVP, LN, etc.), whereas those that did not uphold ‘learning’ failed to (or have yet to) consolidate into a CD, BNP, FNb/DNb).;N

Keeping in mind diffusion’s four critical dimensions, one should further analyse these dimensions.;N
Who are the agents in this particular trans-national diffusion process, what are their characteristics that can facilitate or impede trans-national diffusion patterns, and how do their roles vary throughout their life cycle?;N
What exactly are the objects of diffusion, what role do they play in the development of a party, what exactly influences an innovation’s effectiveness and payoff, and to what extent do the innovations need to be aligned with a specific socio-political context?;N
How do the different mechanisms and channels influence diffusion and its potential success, what are the primary factors at the origin of the proposed conditionality, how exactly do these mechanisms and channels influence FRP development, and (how) is it possible to include these dynamics in a formal model of FRP development?;N
In addition to these more ‘descriptive’ questions, a number of ‘why’ questions should also have a place in future research.;N
Why does a particular object diffuse in favour of another object?;N
More specifically, why has the FN’s proposed master frame served as an inspiration for so many FRPs, and not one designed by another FRP?;N
But also more generally, why does trans-national diffusion between FRPs take place at the time it does?;N
These questions - and so many other ‘why ‘questions in social science - are notoriously difficult to answer because of the inherent difficulty of social science to provide complete and comprehensive accounts of the intentions and experiences involved in a widespread phenomenon like trans-national diffusion between FRPs.;N
Nonetheless, regardless of its complexity, future research should not avoid these questions.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract The importance of social networks for innovation diffusion and processes of social change is widely recognized in many areas of practice and scientific disciplines.;N
Social networks have the potential to influence learning processes, provide opportunities for problem-solving, and establish new ideas.;N
Thus, they can foster synergy effects, bring together key resources such as know-how of participating actors, and promote innovation diffusion.;N
There is wide agreement regarding the usefulness of empirical methods of Social Network Analysis (SNA) for innovation and futures research.;N
Even so, studies that show the chances of implementing SNA in these fields are still missing.;N
This contribution addresses the research gap by exploring the opportunities of a mixed methods SNA approach for innovation research.;N
It introduces empirical results of the author’s own quantitative and qualitative investigations that concentrate on five different innovation networks in the field of Education for Sustainable Development.;N

The third section discusses the value of a social network perspective for innovation research.;N
The methodological approach, along with the empirical case studies used, is outlined in the fourth section.;N
The fifth section shows how a combination of both insights from structure based on quantitative SNA and subjective perceptions revealed with qualitative SNA is helpful for understanding innovation processes.;N
Here, the integration of qualitative SNA such as egocentric network maps in quantitative techniques of SNA is illustrated.;N
The contribution concludes with a summary of main arguments.;N
 Theoretical and methodological background While in the scientific literature there are diverse understandings on what a social network is, this contribution draws on the definition used by Stanley Wassermann and Katherine Faust: “A social network consists of a finite set or sets of actors and the relation or relations defined on them.;N
The presence of relational information is a critical and defining feature of a social network” [1].;N
This conception of social network permits both a governance approach and empirical techniques of SNA.;N
Scholars of governance research understand social networks as a certain type of governance that can be differentiated from other ideal types of governance: markets and hierarchies.;N
Social networks combine market-based and hierarchic dimensions and serve as a form of hybrid governance [2].;N
Both weak and strong modes of coordination are integrated into the network concept of governance research, where strong coordination is defined as “the spectrum of activity in which one This article uses the concep light the relevance of re search.;N

Thus, techniques of egocentric SNA provide us with necessary information with respect to network membership and structural interconnections between actors.;N
Structural properties detected in the context of this project are, for example, centrality, prestige, or weak and strong ties.;N
Innovation potentials through network development strategies: Looking at network structures not only fosters the development and diffusion of new ideas.;N
It can also reveal where and how structural conditions enable innovations and development processes.;N
Furthermore, Social Network Analyses disclose where and how cooperation can be optimized and where and how alterations are possible and reasonable.;N
Presenting stakeholders the results of SNA can foster structural changes.;N
Identification and promotion of coordination, information, and motivation: Analysis of social networks provides us with useful insights into knowledge transfer processes, showing where they exist and how “well” they function.;N
Also, problems of coordination, information, and motivation become evident, providing us with knowledge related to development potentials.;N
Development of strategies to reduce uncertainties related to innovation processes: The costs of information exchange are not only material (money, time), but also social.;N
Uncertainties, lack of confidence, and the fear of a loss of reputation can prevent actors from sharing information and knowledge.;N
Results of SNA help us to identify weaknesses in the knowledge transfer process.;N

The questionnaire first as their ESD network, defined collaboration, problem-solv dents were also asked to a quency for each relation me with whom the interviewe had established high lev requested to score thei and the relevance with re 25, Page 4 of 9 Insights from structures and individuals: engaging top-down and bottom-up approaches Empirical results were visualized drawing back on UCINET, Netdraw, and Pajek in order to provide a comprehensive foundation for stakeholders [14, 15].;N
Top-down visualizations of network data were used to generate courses of action, guidance, and network management strategies with the persons involved in the process.;N
Thus, network visualizations and empirical insights enabled stakeholders to detect weaknesses related to structural issues, information flows, and communication problems.;N
In order to visualize the networks, directional relations between network members were entered into UCINET and mapped with Netdraw.;N
The iterative method of “spring embedding” was chosen for the graph-theoretic layout, because it supports neat illustrations of data sets.;N
Thus, the lengths of the ties do not have information content.;N
The nodes in network visualizations represent persons engaged in implementing ESD in their municipalities.;N
Against the backdrop of the definition of network boundaries, persons that are represented by nodes with only one ingoing link and no outgoing link were not interviewed.;N
To give an example, one surprising result was the low level of cooperation beyond municipal borders, as measured by network connections, as seen in Fig.;N

2 Cooperation in the development of new ideas in Erfurt, source: Author’s data There are only a few network members engaged in developing new ideas with respect to ESD in Erfurt, many structural holes shape the ESD network.;N
In contrast, cooperation in the development of new ideas related to ESD works very well in Gelsenkirchen, as seen in Fig.;N
3.;N
Figure 3 presents productive relationships in Gelsenkirchen.;N
Gelsenkirchen was chosen as an example here because it demonstrates a nearly perfect cooperation basis, which is very supportive for successful innovation processes.;N
Such results can be used by involved actors in order to disclose strengths and weaknesses and reveal where and how structural conditions enable innovations and development processes.;N
The network visualizations shown so far are mainly reduced to structural information.;N
Network visualizations can also integrate further actor-related information.;N

Altogether 25 network maps and interviews, five in every municipality, were generated.;N
Interviewees were chosen according to their area of activity (to obtain a variance of the cases), their position within the social network, and their centrality indexes.;N
To give an example, Fig.;N
5 presents the network map of a central politician in Alheim.;N
This network map of Alheim is also chosen to further illustrate the case of Alheim, which was also depicted in Fig.;N
4.;N
Furthermore, this ESD actor in Alheim possesses a high centrality value according to quantitative SNA.;N
As Fig.;N
5 shows, the interviewee mainly distinguishes five areas of activity: civil society, educational institutions, government/administration, business, and persons from trans-regional contexts.;N
In some cases, the politician just wrote down an organization.;N
During the interview, he referred to concrete persons from these organizations.;N
Surprisingly, the sector of government/administration, to which the interviewee himself belongs, is empty: no persons or organizations are indicated.;N
This is also reflected in the visualization based on quantitative network data (Fig.;N

Furthermore, centrality is not reduced to one person or one sector.;N
Instead, actors from different sectors play a central role in the field of ESD and cooperation between state and non-state actors is very high.;N
In this way, it was possible to develop and realize aims in the area of political accountability in a short space of time.;N
The dense network structure, supported by strong relations between one central politician and actors from other sectors, resulted in the elaboration of an innovative educational plan, composed according to the principles of ESD.;N
At the same time, future strategies should focus on integrating actors from other important areas such as schools.;N
In addition, strategies that foster trans-regional cooperation would be helpful with the diffusion of ESD.;N
With respect to some of the municipalities, a future strategy that fosters greater participation of stakeholders from other areas of activity, as required by the UN’s International Implementation Scheme (IIS) and the National Action Plan of the UN Decade may be helpful in promoting the implementation and diffusion of the social innovation ESD.;N
Business actors and teachers, in particular, complain about not being sufficiently integrated into ESD networks and that the same people always take control and create turf wars.;N
Furthermore, a lack of transparency and information exchange on existing ESD projects was seen.;N
Business actors in these municipalities faced biases from other actors concerned that they ignored ecological and social dimensions of sustainable development.;N
In some municipalities, ESD is mainly concentrated on environmental topics and many ESD actors express reservations about business aims.;N
However, if different sectors are not integrated, it’s difficult to achieve a balance between ecological, economic, and social dimensions, as it has been proclaimed by the concept of sustainable development as such.;N

A quantitative SNA technique for innovation research.;N
In of social networks in the dif Eur J Futures Res (2013) 1:25 network maps enable us to detect where and how innovations and development processes may be possible due to structural and subjective conditions.;N
Finally, compared to conventional statistical analysis that treat structural and individual levels as separately, analyses and visualizations of network data give us more information about the influence of social relations.;N
SNA enables us to capture the interaction between actors and social context, to better understand how innovations are implemented and diffused, to analyze how and why social or educational change takes place or does not take place, and to disclose opportunities for future strategies.;N
This contribution has shown that SNA can begin to answer questions related to innovation processes.;N
I hope it will open new avenues for further uses of SNA in innovation and futures research.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract The European integration project is confronting one of the greatest challenges in its recent history.;N
The profound current financial crisis is jeopardising both trust in the process of integration and the support of European Union citizens.;N
This paper aims to show the need to find transversal solutions to the immediate and future challenges that the European integration project faces.;N
These solutions could emerge from the retrieval of the idea of including a European Dimension in Education, as a joint political strategy of the European Union and the Council of Europe, given that two separate, but convergent, trends have been identified.;N
Special importance will be placed on the four action points that the European dimension could adopt (curricular and teaching materials, creation of school networks and extracurricular activities, initial and on going teacher training, and styles of centre management, leadership and administration).;N
A firm commitment to embed a great deal of Europeanism into the education of the younger European generations (from the earliest age possible) would favour both a greater, and better, Introduction Nobody can now ignore tha predicament, this obliges E if the region wishes to re motivated the current proje rope, establishing a closer regions.;N

These two aspects represent together a geopolitical and virtual Europe, in the widest sense of the word, that expands itself, but the governing idea is that it rests on a number of values that become relevant in a common contractualised project [17].;N
This is the global Europe that must look at itself today and assess if it is able to move forward with the political project, without taking into consideration Europe’s main asset: its citizens.;N
This is the immediate challenge of 21st century Europe and of Europeans themselves: to integrate the different versions of Europe into one political project that defends the inclusion of a European Dimension in Education (EDE) as an immediate answer to the present and future European challenges.;N
Consequently, it is a matter of urgency to find solutions which inspire the European social and political mass and which offer answers to the great challenges that the European political organisations confront.;N
Our proposal focuses on the support of the inclusion of the EDE in a joint and transversal manner, with the aim of favouring education for democratic citizenship (EDC), Europeanism, a European identity and the premise of unity in diversity, via the paradigm of lifelong learning.;N
This idea acquires its heritage (acquis communautaire) and all its sense in the framework of the COE and the EU, it is a key concept that deserves to be revitalised and recuperated for political and social European action.;N
Furthermore, four essential action points can be identified, in which the EDE could act in a decisive way, thus favouring the understanding and consolidation of the idea of Europe among its citizens considering that the forthcoming challenge of re-building Europe is a democratic project that should be immediately embedded in educational and training establishments.;N

Diestro and Gª Blanco [14] underlined that reports and resolutions about critical subjects that aggravated European educational systems (expansion and democratisation of education, language learning and its methodologies, construction of schools, education for all, schooling for the children of immigrants, etc.) were written in the SCME until 1971.;N
However, the beginning of a potential cooperation, in relation to education in the context of the European Community, led to an increase of attention with regard to the styles and methods of intergovernmental political cooperation in education, rather than with regard to the actual content in education.;N
The conviction to expand European cooperation in relation to education was also expressed via the SCME, to offer better opportunities to the young, in a world where competitiveness was increasingly more intense and the international cooperation was turning out to be progressively more necessary.;N
The expansion of education in Europe—a key aspect at that moment and an area around which the initial interest of the SCME revolved—was determined by the demographic growth of the post-war period, as well as by the rapprochement of children and young people who had remained cut off from education over this period.;N
There was an enormous education demand in all European countries, which led to the enlargement of compulsory education up to secondary level, as well as to a greater demand for technical and professional qualifications as instruments to guarantee access to the common market and to mobility.;N
Ministers had detected common problems in the different member states and, given the situation, it was deemed that a revision and detailed analysis of the problems of education in Europe was necessary.;N
Common actions had to be established to start up a collective process towards the improvement of European education systems, with a view to a new social horizon: events in 1968 represented parities, in spite of the diffe country, between the educa which was in the process contents were not establish unpredictability that chara 1969 the SCME ministers d examine working methods way of proceeding, espec common tendencies and th Europe, with a view to suc monious and converging tr The development of educa It is not our aim to make Europe, as there are alread describe its historical evol tinctive elements (principle factors and critical analysis example, the work compl admit that, in the first yea Community, education was nor an area to be considered However, the first meeting Community at the beginnin tion of the Janne Report education, would lead to su of establishing precise and Since 1971, Member Sta interest that Communit education produces.;N

The aforementioned Programme experienced serious problems at its outset, which commenced in particular sectors in the middle of the eighties.;N
The deep economic crisis at the end of the 1970s caused by the constant increase in petrol prices, and high inflation and unemployment rates, did not favour the increment in economic budget lines that should have been allocated to the new policy in education.;N
Consequently, the fulfilment of the planned actions would be delayed by more than five years, due to the lack of economic resources in the Community [13:220–221].;N
Finally, education and citizenship would not form part of EU law until the Treaty on European Union (TEU, 1992), acknowledging policy in education as one of the areas of EU cooperation and establishing a medium-hard regulatory and political connection among its Member States.;N
In Maastricht, European citizenship was also recognised as a complement to, rather than a replacement of, national citizenship (a wide range of citizens’ rights that expanded the coverage from a national to a supranational framework).;N
Art.;N
126 of the TEU even included the intention to grant a European dimension to the experience of students and teachers of the Member States.;N
Despite that, the EU, due to its idiosyncrasy and its policy in education based on principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and absolute respect of national competences, has never adopted a decisive stand to favour education.;N
Citizenship is recognised, but the interest to develop its education systems is left in the hands of the Member States without specifying the establishment of guaranteed minimums in all States.;N
Obviously, it is not about obliging Member States to renounce their national competencies, but if they have agreed to expand citizenship to a supranational framework, it would be logical that the Member States themselves guaranteed to one another that it would be done in such a way.;N

The following bar chart reveals the documents that the COE and EU have devoted to the EDE in different periods over more than 50 years.;N
These periods define the tendencies of each organisation as regards strategies, objectives, contents and scope.;N

But, what does the EU understand when it refers to the EDE in the framework of its cooperation policy on education?;N
It is an adjustment and coherence element in the national education processes and systems in the face of the new economic, social and cultural context, promoted by the Single Market and by the education competencies assumed by the Community at the TEU.;N
This idea lies on the development of European citizenship, on offering opportunities to improve quality in education, and on training young people in their transition and integration towards social and working lives, via a framework of key competencies, as an added value to the general goals of education.;N
Its motivation is supplementary and its orientation is geared towards the peripheral elements (instrumental aspects) of education systems, especially using mobility, exchanges, European language learning and EDC.;N
To some extent, the EU promotes the EDE towards education for Europe in an almost instrumental manner, pushing the attitudinal facets vis-à-vis Europe into the background of its political action.;N
And, what does the COE understand when it refers to the EDE in the framework of its intergovernmental policy in education?;N
The best reflection of the global interpretation of the EDE in the COE can be expressed via the thoughts articulated by the Group of Experts for the EDE, who understand that it is a system of attitudes and intellectual approximations that rest on pluralism, tolerance, receptivity towards others and, finally, on the development of individual capacities, such as the capacity for synthesis, critical analysis and personal judgement [7:210 ophy in education that ha educational programmes, activities, as well as educ defined via the EDE idea systems.;N

Its acceptance as a key concept in Europe, and its direct implications in education policies, grant it a remarkable value that allows it to incorporate itself into all sorts of aspects related to supranational cooperation in education, whilst tinting it with a good deal of Europeanism.;N
The potential of the political and pedagogical symbiosis of the EDE lies in its capacity to bring together these two dimensions.;N
It even promotes the pooling (at European level) of ideas, experiences and attempts regarding good pedagogical practices with which the challenges, needs, obstacles and common problems of European education systems (such as the typical elements of educational trends that take place in Europe in the 21st century) may be confronted.;N
In contrast, as long as the EDE finds an insurmountable obstacle in the principles of subsidiarity, and that Member States deem that the actual inclusion of this idea could signify a lack of respect towards its national competencies, it will not be possible to change the current outlook or the political vision in Europe.;N
In the emerging European education space, education is governed by the principle of subsidiarity, and member states retain the control over the structure and the content of their school curricula.;N
European education policies are therefore not binding and member states could easily ignore European initiatives in this area [21:95].;N
However, every attempt to define or set out this idea should be obliged to base itself on the educational heritage (acquis communautaire) acquired by both organisations over more than half a century of cooperation.;N
The EDE is not solely just another element of European education policy, it is the quintessence that should infuse and pass through all its aspects.;N
It is not possible to conceive any type of European education policy (complementary or convergent) without the idea of the EDE as a key core question.;N
Therefore, to satisfy the objective of integrating it into orientations that make up development of an Europe other elements: In the same way, all the p try to introduce and favo attention to three key el and the understanding o generations: European id to the world).;N

[9:6].;N
Therefore, we understand that, given the challenge of integrating the EDE as a future road map, four primary areas of action must be specially highlighted, which are very important in their development: a) syllabus and teaching materials, b) creation of school networks and encouragement of extracurricular activities, c) initial and ongoing teacher training, and d) management, leadership and administration styles at teaching centres.;N
Yet, identifying and promoting these areas of action is as important as developing them in a coherent and integrating manner, according to the unity in diversity of the Member States.;N
Inclusion of the European dimension in the curriculum, and teaching materials Since the outset of the EDE, the aspect of including the idea of Europe as educational content in the curricula has not been studied in detail [4].;N
On the contrary, in many cases it has turned out to be quite a controversial question due to the Member States’ evident reluctance to cooperate in these core matters.;N
Within the framework of the EU, the Member States have never been overenthusiastic about the idea, and hence they have focused their efforts on instrumental areas of the EDE.;N
In fact, from the start of European collaboration, there has been a general consensus about the ineffectiveness of introducing the idea of Europe as a new subject area in school programmes, already too overloaded, there is even the potential danger that it is reduced to a marginal school subject.;N
In contrast, the COE has indeed devised innovative teaching approaches, such as the programme of educational materials to teach about the European dimension (1993).;N
The COE programme focused on the creation of several dossiers and monographs, as well as on their organisation and programmes of basic and c itself in the syllabus as one local, national and regiona learning and school exchan particularly, a matter of int teaching centres, and it r teaching act, according to l and teaching materials [10 content leads to a change in A more appropriate me dimension in the conten of revisiting the present stance, introducing the i topic can be tackled fro looks, according to the t according to different sch starting point could be a European dimension, pe tent and more as a syst approximations based o ness to other individual opment of personal cap and think critically in judgement [6:4].;N

The so-called Pedagogy behind school exchanges [5] must figure prominently and would imply aspects such as teacher training aimed at school links and exchanges, exchanges as elements in both the curriculum and educational programmes, and the potential that ICT offers in their development.;N
However, in spite of the fact that many European educational establishments have joined different patterns of school exchanges or links via European programmes, it has not yet become a conventional practice in Europe.;N
In some way, it has not been possible, at a national dimension, for schools to be supported, encouraged and motivated to perform multilateral activities.;N
Above all, school exchanges denote a key element for mutual understanding in a multicultural society.;N
These experiences of inter-school collaboration rely on teachers as the main actors in their implementation and development.;N
They are also useful to encourage innovative pilot experiences, to consolidate the flow of information among teachers, as well as to reuse and reinforce teaching methodologies that favour good practices with a European dimension.;N
Similarly, students and their families are the main beneficiaries, as they are given the opportunity to participate in exchanges, to get drawn in and take part in life at school.;N
These activities are based on direct experiences that imply specific situations, close to real life, that place the emphasis on problem-solving, on obtaining concrete results via teamwork and assumed common responsibilities.;N
For example, it is necessary to highlight the e-twinning initiative (www.etwinning.;N

Educational leadership is related to education and the effects it has on students’ level of achievement and their direct learning experiences [1].;N
The European Commission has placed special attention on leadership in education in the European context, as a strategy to raise quality in education, providing adequate initial teacher training and continuous development of teaching staff, and to make teaching an inviting choice as a professional career [16:11].;N
Its main strength lies in the fact that, to orientate the European dimension towards education implies the development of a profound, structural Europeanist project, with schools and educational establishments at its heart, and the leadership of education professionals who are competent in the European dimension.;N
The choice to include the EDE in school life must go hand in hand with a careful and thought-out planning stage, based on the culture of participation and on the openness of educational establishments to the community to which they belong.;N
In this perspective, the educational establishment becomes the epicentre of diversity and Europeanism, in line with the closest local context (doing a better convergence between the peoples and regions in Europe).;N
 Conclusions The EDE aims to imbue national education systems with a Europeanist substance, which complements national traditions, and rests on the common principles and values of our historical heritage and the cultural legacy (acquis communautaire) shared by all Europeans.;N
Its strength lies in the progressive installation of a new Europeanist philosophy of education (via a transformational undercurrent), which favours openness with regard to education systems, policies and teaching practices in Europe.;N
This process, established in a coherent and functional manner, will encourage the creation cornerstone of the suprana of the 21st century.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Research indicates that evidence-based policy making is most successful when public administrators refer to diversified information portfolios.;N
With the rising prominence of social media in the last decade, this paper argues that governments can benefit from integrating this publically available, user-generated data through the technique of social media analytics (SMA).;N
There are already several initiatives set up to predict future policy issues, e.g.;N
for the policy fields of crisis mitigation or migrant integration insights.;N
The authors analyse these endeavours and their potential for providing more efficient and effective public policies.;N
Furthermore, they scrutinise the challenges to governmental SMA usage in particular with regards to legal and ethical aspects.;N
Reflecting the latter, this paper provides forward-looking recommendations on how these technologies can best be used for future policy making in a legally and ethically sound manner.;N

Analysing more than three million tweets, many hours of YouTube videos and thousands of blog entries in Tunisia and Egypt, Howard, Duffy et al.;N
[5] for instance came to the conclusion that “social media played a central role in shaping political debates in the Arab Spring”.;N
They found that revolutionary activities in the brick-and-mortar world often followed after a large rise of social media communication.;N
Investigating the role of social media during the post-election upheavals in Iran in 2009, Müller and van Hüllen [6] distinguish between a power shift and media shift.;N
They found an “interplay between a mediascape, where many-to-many media increasingly matter and the powerscape, where reaching many will always matter” [6].;N
Evidence shows that also in Western societies, citizens increasingly make use of social media for campaigning for their political goals [7].;N
In this paper we will discuss under which conditions it is legitimate and effective for governments to count on SMA.;N
First we will describe the societal and technological changes that came along with the emergence of Web 2.0 applications as well as the impacts on government-society relations.;N
Thereafter, we will examine how governments and public administrations are making use of social media and SMA in the context of e-governance policies.;N
In the subsequent section we will present the example of the European research project UniteEurope that is developing an SMA-tool for local governments in the field of migrant integration policy support.;N
The last two sections focus on challenges for governments coming with SMA usage.;N
 Web2.0 technologies and their role in civic engagement The emergence of the World Wide Web in the 1990s and the appearance of social networks changed our societies’ communication patterns as well as the relations among citizens, between Web2.0 technologies o for engagement, participa oration as they allow each net access to publish, sh videos, photos etc.;N

The “Twitter Revolution” have the mainly youth-led uphe media to start, discuss and spective dictators and their Howard and Hussain [14] role of Twitter, Facebook e “Democratization move technologies such as m came to these countries people sharing an intere networks, created social action, virtual network Brave citizens made the tarian rule known, and d Eur J Futures Res (2013) 1:20 Social media and SMA for governments Governmental institutions and political stakeholders make use of social media tools in various ways and for different purposes [12, 15, 16].;N
These actors are active on Facebook and Twitter which they use, amongst others, for promoting their policies, campaigns, or popularity, whilst the purposes, tools and goals vary.;N
“Social media strongly supports network communications and enables governments to communicate better within the multiple networks outside of government and the informal organization (networks) within government.;N
Leveraging these networks offers enhanced opportunities to achieve public goals” [17].;N
In the case of politicians’ and parties’ online activities, the aim is often to gain support, increase engagement of citizens, or raise a candidate’s profile [11, 18–20].;N
The most prominent example so far was US President Obama’s election campaign in 2008, which “has often been described as the first electoral campaign in which the use of social media had a decisive impact” [19] and has set a “precedent for the use of social media applications as election tools” [20].;N
For governments, one of the major motives for using information and communication technologies (ICT) at all is to increase transparency.;N
In this regard, “(…) the Internet has greatly reduced the cost of collecting, distributing, and accessing government information” [9, 21].;N
Whilst internetbased e-government services have taken root in the past decade, we detect the trend that web2.0 technologies are of increasing interest for governments and tend to provide a convincing and unbureaucratic alternative for giving access to information and, more globally, for demonstrating transparency.;N
As Bertot et al.;N
[9] phrase it: “The social media applications of the Internet (…) have the potential to enhance existing and foster new cultures of openness”.;N
This is in line with other authors, such as Mäkinen and Kuira [22], who producing public value, a accountability of governm in the increasing audience ernment agency accomplis Given that social media outcome of what is commo society”, they can be see According to Keenan et al.;N

1 E-consultation tools used by governments [26] governments in 78 UN member states (i.e.;N
40 % of all member states), indicated by a statement such as “Follow us on Facebook or Twitter” on government websites [26].;N
The UN 2012 Survey concludes that Facebook and Twitter are “(…) increasingly being deployed by governments as vehicles for consultation.;N
The 24–7 reach of these tools provides a cost effective mechanism for citizen alerts as well as for views on how the government is doing.;N
(…) The number of countries encouraging government officials to respond to citizen input more than doubled, from 16 to 38” [26].;N
Beyond the sheer social media usage of governments to communicate with citizens and/or receive information and feedback, the phenomenon of crowdsourcing for e-government becomes more and more pertinent.;N
The underlying idea that governments make use of specialist as well as local knowledge of citizens in order to improve their administrative processes and public services is fairly recent.;N
Inspired by the success of open source software communities to voluntarily and co-creatively provide public goods the concept of crowdsourcing spilled over to self-selected experts beyond the scope of software development.;N
Projects such as “FixMyStreet” in the UK or “Marker Brandenburg” in Germany provide a privately (in the case of the former) or publicly (in the case of the latter) operated infrastruc- automated SMA-tools.;N

In any case, governments should be given appropriate means to explore the social web for themselves.;N
As a forward-looking, trends-detecting method, particularly SMA can be applied in a highly beneficial manner as good practises prove.;N
This should be exemplified by the EU research project “UniteEurope” in the next section.;N
 Step 2: Step 3: UniteEurope: A SMAT for local governments “UniteEurope” (www.uniteeurope.org) is a European Commission funded research and development project that is set out to support local governments in Europe in their efforts to foster urban integration of immigrants.;N
The underlying idea of UniteEurope is to provide public administrators and NGOs with user-generated contents publically communicated via social media that helps them to detect trends in their citizens’ (i.e.;N
immigrants’ and autochthones’) discourses relevant for integration.;N
This concerns local public policy and measures in all phases of the life cycle including planning, implementation, execution and evaluation.;N
For instance, if there are many postings pointing out migrant discrimination in a particular entertainment facility via social media, one might expect tensions in this area in the near future.;N
Integration specialists will be able to counteract this faster by immediately approaching the said facility to prevent further escalation, e.g.;N
by providing a mediation service.;N
As any SMAT set-up to operate in the governmental sector, UniteEurope is based on the assumption that citizens have access to and are willing to provide particular aspects of expert knowledge governments have difficulties to draw on.;N
Focusing on this particular policy field, the project’s aim is Step 4: Step 5: Step 6: matrix (“grid mod vant for the endea Social scientists ha of the involved cit Vienna) by analy sues, the relevant the current polic measures.;N

As Wetzstein and Leitner [34] elaborate, public bodies making use of social media analyses do not “focus on people as customers or consumers, but as citizens (…) and often act in fields of “great societal relevance and political interest”.;N
Therefore, SMAT designed for governmental purposes require more elaborate considerations on legal and ethical aspects for a variety of reasons.;N
In the first place, social media have changed our very notion of privacy.;N
Participants seem to care little when it comes to sharing personal information about oneself, about one’s friends or networks in digital environments.;N
Often it is difficult for the user to distinguish between what is public and what is private [4].;N
“The space for private, unidentified, or unauthenticated activity is rapidly shrinking.;N
(…) nearly every human transaction is subject to tracking, monitoring, and the possibility of authentication and identification” [35].;N
The fact that the very concept of privacy is becoming increasingly blurred is further exacerbated by the absence of clear privacy regulations in the field information and communication technologies in general and social media in particular.;N
While it seems that privacy concerns tend to be of minor importance to social media users, empirical evidence proposes that such concerns are increasing when users interact directly with governmental agencies, e.g.;N
via e-government services.;N
According to the World Bank, “[c]itizens often express concern about the security of their private and confidential information, possible surveillance, and anonymity” [33].;N
The authors suggest that “(w)ithout strong protection or the quick resolution of any breach, citizens will be wary of sharing their information with the government, and efforts to connect and interact would quickly be undermined” [33].;N
As a consequence, citizens’ acceptability of governments making use of social media – a sphere where the legal framework is weak and users tend to feel unobserved—requires Data Protection Directive ( the relevant national acts t Directive (DPD) in the EU m the question of the “data su not necessarily the only “da because this individual ca “data subject”.;N
In the case data” of a third person, th lished information”.;N
The “p such illegitimately publishe ject” commits an activity r principles.;N
Thus, the SMAT purpose of the tool is not to future policy [36].;N
It goes w regulations do not hold bus ments, however, it can be o concerned with this legally interest to strive for transpa Recommendations from guarantee a careful selection their compliance with Euro legislation, but also to rende by hiding their names and the tool.;N

Translating often unprecedentedly large, complex and conflicting bodies of information into actionable, robust insight is a significant challenge that has not been overcome.” [4] The aspect of rumors on social media is more and more coming into focus of current research, notably in the field of SMA use for crisis mitigation [37].;N
Public bodies that intend to use the information retrieved from social media for policy making need to be aware of these deficiencies in order to know how to interpret and evaluate the information, however there has not been any significant progress yet.;N
In this regard, it is crucial to inform end users about the limits of the tool with regards to interpretation.;N
A more severe issue in terms of (research) ethics is that of the missing “informed consent” in SMA, comprehensively dealt with in Krieger, Grubmüller et al.;N
[36].;N
“Being in compliance with the law is one step to diminish ethical concerns, but must be considered a minimum standard only for coming up to ethical requirements concerning data protection.;N
In this regard, the lack of ‘informed consent’ is an issue that requires precautions in order to protect the authors of postings who might not be aware of the public availability of their contents, let alone of their deployment for research purposes.” [36] Whereas the issue of informed consent is also encountered in conventional research methods (e.g.;N
unobtrusive observation), the authors consider it particularly delicate in SMAT “due to the very nature of ‘digital reality’ that allows fast and easy detection of data” [36].;N
Especially younger users are often depending on variables suc der, etc.), the strong presen tions in social networks and (certain groups of) migran ogy has been developed project.;N

Awareness raising form them of both the oppo new technologies hold for vent potential (unintende Krieger, Grubmüller et al.;N
viders to “providing man contain sensitizing informa are being gathered as well which the results bear” .;N
 20, Page 8 of 9 Next to the generally higher sensitivity of governments towards legal and ethical aspects of technology use, current incidents such as privacy attacks over social media by governmental institutions have increased inhibitions to collect and make use of online user-generated contents.;N
However, as this article points out, social media are an ideal solution to support foresight and future-oriented policy making, therefore, the advantages of SMA for governments shall not be overlooked.;N
Thus it is all the more crucial for SMAT-providers to guarantee for an ethically and legally sound approach.;N
This is demonstrated in this article with the good practice of the European research project “UniteEurope” which counts on the assurance of anonymity, the restriction to publically available contents and the utmost compliance to European and relevant national legal standards.;N
In addition, ethical requirements have been elaborated together with the end users and international NGOs, they serve as benchmark and have thus highly influenced the methodology applied during the development of the tool, notably with regards to the selection of social media sources, the presentation of results (quantitative vs.;N
qualitative approach) or the resignation on technological innovations such as sentiment analysis.;N
Awareness raising activities with the end users (local governments) is another decisive factor.;N
Building on the case of UniteEurope, we point to the opportunities, limits and risks with regards to governmental SMA usage.;N
We are concluding that governments should be given the possibility to explore SMA, keeping in mind that for assuring transparency and social acceptability, they shall decide on a case-to-case basis whether it is the most suitable instrument for their needs.;N
For UniteEurope, the developed SMAT constitutes a valuable solution because it is at the crossing point of (1) providing insight on the current state of the public discourse on migrant integration (thereby supporting policy makers in “understanding the true nature of the present” [42], and (2) enabling foresight methods aiming at improving the current and forecasted situation with 2.;N

The emergence of “Western” research and its production of expertise, 1950s to Elke Seefried Received: 15 September 2013 / Accepted: 17 October 2013 / Published online: 4 December 2013 # The Author(s) 2013.;N
This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract This article deals with the emergence of Futures Research after 1945 and its production of future expertise.;N
The field of futures research (or futures studies/futurology) was conceptualised in a process of circulating knowledge in Western Europe and the USA during the 1950s and 1960s.;N
These approaches to thinking about, forecasting and planning the future drew their arsenal of new methods largely from the field of cybernetics (such as Systems Analysis).;N
What is more, futures research produced expertise for policy development and strategic planning.;N
As a result of the dynamic changes in science and technology and the breakthrough of Keynesianism, the 1960s symbolized the high time of political planning in Western Europe and the USA.;N
The paper aims to analyse the forms and character of future expertise utilized in government and administration during the 1960s.;N
It will focus on West German futures research and its advisory role for the Federal Government but will also take transnational transfers of knowledge and comparative aspects into account.;N
The paper will show that major strands of futures research of the 1960s In 1967, Olaf Helmer of the article on “Long range fore “The decade of the Six portant change in the i many parts of the world toward the future that ha private planning agenc community.;N

A form of politics oriented towards the future must be inspired by the will to prevent noticeable and undesirable developments, to tackle at an early stage noticeable and undesirable developments, but above all: to recognise, to promote and to initiate desirable developments.” [93 Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, p 33].;N
The Social Democratic Party was more or less confident that science would possess the tools needed to systematically anticipate possible, probable and “willed” futures, thus providing the knowledge for future-oriented politics, for modernization and planning.;N
Did futures research provide scientific policy advice?;N
Which forms of knowledge were utilized in government and what were the effects of this future expertise?;N
This article explores the “founding years” of modern futures research in Western industrialised countries emerging in the late 1950s and 1960s (I.).2 It furthermore sheds light on the forms of knowledge produced as well as the ways and extent to which this expertise was utilized for government and administration in the late 1960s and early 1970s (II.) This second chapter focuses on West German futures research but also takes transnational transfers of knowledge into account.;N
Expertise is understood here as an informed, though not necessarily scientific, knowledge with a link to political decision-making and solving of relevant social problems [83 Saretzky].;N
It should be kept in mind here that scientific knowledge is never incorporated into the political process on a one-to-one basis, but that the communication channels, the flow and diffusion of knowledge between the experts, politics and administration are of epistemological interest [8 Ash, 36 Gieryn, 106 Weiss, 10 Beck & Bonß, 80 Ronge, 104 Weingart 1983].;N
This is also true for the public sphere(s).;N
As scientific knowledge is always inextricably linked with its cultural and social contexts, recent research steering.;N

Hence, it was this time was conceptualised in t Generally, futures research ments in science and techn These developments were i Eur J Futures Res (2014) 15:29 on an interdisciplinary basis [34 Galison & Hevly, 67 Leslie].;N
These think tanks, such as the RAND Corporation, provided the methods and techniques for the military and strategic planning of US administrations [1 Abella, 5 Amadae, 20 Collins].;N
Methodologically, these new methods were based on the theoretical foundations of behaviourism, and they drew their arsenal mainly from two new theories developed in close proximity to the think tanks.;N
These were, on the one hand, game theory as an approach to estimating strategic decisions in conflict situations [73 Neumann & Morgenstern, 66 Leonard], and, on the other hand, cybernetics as the new meta-science of communication and control in animate and inanimate systems.;N
Stating that biological, technological, and social systems behave quite similarly in that they are structured by transfers of information, cybernetics explored regulation and control mechanisms and information flows within complex systems and between the system and its environment.;N
From a natural science point of view, cybernetics seemed to be a meta-approach to understanding how systems behave, how they “learn” by integrating new information and how they can be steered [107, 108 Wiener, 39 Hagner, 49 Heims, 92 Schmidt-Gernig].;N
At RAND, Systems Analysis was designed as a cybernetics-inspired science of strategy which laid the foundations for methods such as systems-based computer simulations, war gaming and a systematic analysis of experts’ opinions on specific future developments (the socalled Delphi method) to forecast the future.4 However, the think tanks only provided the methods.;N
Ideas to conceptualise futures research as a meta-discipline to think about, forecast and plan the future grew out of transatlantic circulations of knowledge.;N
The central forum was the Congress for Cultural Freedom.;N
Shaped by the mentalities of the Cold War, the Congress brought together intellectuals, scientists and politicians under the aegis of consensus liberalism.;N
As such, the Congress promoted consensual democracy, liberal capitalism and anti-Marxism but also pleaded for plan- and a powerful vehicle for 2, further 19 Coleman, 44 H Berghahn pp 153–70, 183– played the French politica who provided the theoretic future.;N

However, and this is the of scientific knowledge also and new tools for researchi its complexity and in the m the one hand, the computer future developments [4 Ag netics.;N
Cybernetics was hyp 29, Page 4 of 12 This perception was bound up with the third, most important characteristic.;N
All exponents of the futures field were driven by the conviction that many possible futures existed to think about and to be created.;N
Bertrand de Jouvenel coined the term futuribles , combining “future” and “possible”, around 1960 [25 de Jouvenel, p 35].;N
Hence, the plural of “futures” epitomized a central principle of all Western concepts of studying the future.;N
This perception was grounded in different factors.;N
De Jouvenel emphasised in an epistemological sense that there could be no real knowledge about the future.;N
Nonethless, humans could identify desirable futures and actively strive to bring them about.;N
Thus, the image of the open and many futures stemmed from the idea that many futures are creatable and that people can “choose” their own, willed future [25 de Jouvenel, pp 17–32, 6 Andersson], this reflected a sort of “spirit of optimism”(Aufbruchstimmung) in the 1960s.;N
Furthermore, the perception of many futures was linked to a Cold War context: in the West, the future should be planned but was at the same time open and not determined like from a Marxist point of view.;N
As mentioned above, futures research was conceptualised by intellectuals and scientists from different disciplines, driven by different methodological viewpoints and ideas, and this was one reason for different labels epitomizing scientific approaches to forecasting, planning and thinking about the future.;N
Whereas Futures Research was more focused on scientific methods, on forecasting and planning, in the USA the term Futurology circulated in a more populist sense, whereas Ossip Flechtheim in the Federal Republic of Germany sought to emphasise the explicit academic character of Futurologie.;N
In the 1970s Futures Studies gained the upper hand as a term that was broader and sought to encompass all aspects of thinking about, forecasting and planning “futures” [69 Masini, 43 Helmer, 29, 30 Flechtheim].;N
Hence, the field of futures research was fluid.;N
Three different approaches in the 1960s can be identified.;N
First, an empir- or that must be reckoned w chief executive of the Ce particularly shaped by tech feasibility (Machbarkeitsd who had moved to the U Braun in the 1950s, had Marshall Space Flight Ce 1965, he was engaged in im as a new course of study at respect, it was not surpris Centre Berlin should use which was to be “action“political decision support” A second, normative characterised by reflecting a holistic world view.;N

Moreover, this approach stemmed from a branch of the political left which aspired to emancipate human beings from the constrictive political, economic and spiritual structures of the “system”, and thus it was also tied up with emerging peace research.;N
Jungk had published the bestseller “Die Zukunft hat schon begonnen: Amerikas Allmacht und Ohnmacht” (“Tomorrow is already here”) in 1952, in which he accused US civilization of an excessive belief in technological progress, domesticating both nature and man [50 Jungk].;N
In the 1960s he still rejected atomic weapons, but was more open for the promises of the Technical Age.;N
Similarly to Galtung and Flechtheim, he voted in a utopian mode for a “homo novus” (New Man) creating his own future and combining planning and participation [51 Jungk, p.;N
515, cf 52, 53 Jungk, 55 Jungk & Galtung, 91 Seefried, p 159–62].;N
Principally, this approach was inextricably linked with ideas of participation and civil society, stimulating new social movements on a transnational and global scale emerging in the 1960s [109 Wittner, 7 Andersson].;N
Generally speaking, “Western” futures research in the late 1950s and 1960s was bound up with an idea of feasibility, aiming at combining forecasting and planning a better future.;N
This understanding was part and parcel of the intrinsic code of futures research, encapsulating the principle of cybernetics as a method for transgressing the boundaries separating episteme and techne [39 Hagner p 38–9].;N
This does not mean that the futures field was shaped by endless optimism as futurists were also aware of the risks that came along with modernity and its perceived accelerated change.;N
However, they were confident that the “futures” were open and could be planned and steered, and this was mostly combined with a positive understanding of technological progress.;N
 politics came under the sw modernisation, which also Keynesian paradigm [72 M this was true both for Socia many Christian Democrats visions of conservative “ Politicians from different p nical change had altered th dously.;N

This met with the aim research on the future but als that futures research tried to the 1960s, as will be demons of West German futures res This applied most by far to First, the protagonists proach refrained from prov ernment.;N
These futurists fo critical public (in the under civil society and social Galtung founded “Mankin tion engaged in thinking ab and human development tr 29, Page 6 of 12 concentrated on making an impact on the public by means of publications and on discussing “willed futures” with students as a lecturer at the “Technische Universität” in Berlin.;N
From this emerged the concept of future workshops (Zukunftswerkstätten ).;N
In a multilevel model, which in some ways embodied a link between brainstorming and the Delphi method, people were supposed to “invent” their future, i.e.;N
creatively develop it by discussing social problems in a dynamic group process, gathering ideas for solutions and examining their application [24 Dator, 33 Gabor, 91 Seefried, p 167–8].;N
From the second field, of the normative-ontological approach, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who believed he had a particular social and political duty as an atomic physicist, continually pushed the boundaries between the functional systems of science and politics.;N
One way in which he did this was via the public, for example by initiating the Göttingen Declaration of Atomic Physicists in 1957.;N
The arcane field of politics became even more important for him, however, as he focused on having a political impact as an expert.;N
Hence, he entered into the public sphere especially when he aimed at increasing the pressure to act on political actors via the media [61 Kraus, 91 Seefried, pp 96–7, 178–9, 349–51].;N
In the mid1960s von Weizsäcker extended his thoughts from the “atomic age” to the whole “technical age” [101 von Weizsäcker].;N
In general, von Weizsäcker regarded the technical development, with its “rapid tempo”, ambivalently [102 Weizsäcker, p 68].;N
On the one hand, the new “basic sciences” from the sphere of the think tanks, such as cybernetics and games theory, fascinated him.;N
On the other hand, he was well aware of the problematic consequences of technical progress, as was reflected in atomic physics.;N
In order to assess the ambivalent consequences of science and technology for the future, he planned in 1967 to found a “Max Planck Institute for Research into Living Conditions in a Scientific-Technical could be restricted in its in ponents of futures rese Weizsäcker was thus forced in Starnberg in its advisory Seefried, p 351–4, 64 Leen The project “War Con of the Max Planck Instit significance.;N

From an epistemologi Eur J Futures Res (2014) 15:29 Third, protagonists from the field of an empirical-positivist approach attempted most strongly to provide scientific policy advice.;N
The Centre Berlin for Futures Research actively offered itself up for advising politics.;N
The Centre claimed that it could draw up research planning modelling but also be active in the fields of budget planning as well as constructing traffic planning models, population models and global government models.14 It is clear that it was no longer the object – the “what” – that was decisive but the “how”: any topic appeared to be workable because in the centre of focus was the method, and here, above all, the computer-based simulation model.;N
The Centre Berlin established contact in particular with the new planning department of the Federal Chancellery.;N
The planning department had been set up against the backdrop of fresh scientific, political and also media interest in a “modern” and “rational” form of governance.;N
The Chancellery had already come under fire during the “grand coalition” 1966 to 1969: it allegedly fulfilled its duties as an organ of coordination, information and control insufficiently, as it forewent “modern leadership staffs”, “political planning and systematic data management” [110 Zundel, see 95 Süß].;N
Therefore, from 1967 on, a new planning staff should ponder the planning of procedures, i.e.;N
the organisation of political processes, as well as task scheduling, i.e.;N
coordination of fields of activity with regard to a catalogue of aims.;N
This was bound up with setting up the “Project Group for Government and Administrative Reform”.;N
That panel, consisting of representatives of the Chancellery and other ministries, was to submit proposals for better coordination between the individual ministries [96 Süß].;N
The Brandt government which came to power in 1969 then expanded the planning staff into a planning department.;N
This was completely in line with the proposed reform policy: according to Willy Brandt in his first government declaration, the government had to “begin with itself when talking of reforms”.;N
The Federal Chancellery and the ministries should be “modernised in their structures and thus in their work” [17 political problems under and longer-term conseque analytical models, which e the system, was obvious.1 Koelle of the Centre Ber Theis from the planning de was also the chairperson of and Administrative Reform paper before the Projec Administrative Reform.;N

Second, the Centre Berlin was commissioned by the planning department of the Chancellery and the Project Group for Government and Administrative Reform to handle the project PLABUND (Planning Aid in the Federal Administration).;N
For this it received the princely sum of two million marks.;N
The overall concept, according to the Centre Berlin, was guided by the idea that “planning processes in the field of federal administration […] can only be decisively improved by means of specific planning aid that has been coordinated in its functional profile”.18 Thus, the project aimed at “rationalisation”, i.e.;N
the creation of scientificity and efficiency in process planning.;N
The core was the project EIPE (Experimental Integrating Planning and Decision-making System), led by the sociologist Helmut Klages.;N
It aimed at developing “foundations and design criteria for the construction of an interagency information system in the area of government and administration”.;N
According to the abstruse formulations, it attempted to do research on the “space for deliberation of preparatory work for decisions” within the basic units of the federal administration, i.e.;N
the decision-making processes and the scope of action.;N
So far, the preparation of decisions in the individual sections seemed to impede the decision-makers, i.e.;N
the ministers, in making assessments within the overall political concept.;N
In this way, “non-rational determinants of politicaladministration action” were to be reduced.19 The project team ascertained “fundamental assumptions and allocated information holdings” of the administrators “on social, economic and political prerequisites”.;N
This was to take place empirically by means of “participatory observation”.;N
Staff of the Centre Berlin (two political scientists, a sociologist and a economist) was therefore appointed for 3 months to four ministries as assistant administrators.;N
Parallel to this, intensive interviews of the administration with the Centre staff were to take place.;N

It was decisive that the Centre Berlin assumed that it could gather problem scenarios and decision-making processes “completely” and quantify them.;N
Model simulations attempt to imitate and to visualise the complexity of reality, but they can supply only fragmentary knowledge on a virtual model world, which cannot depict social complexity [65 Lenhard].;N
In an engineering mentality of feasibility, the Centre Berlin ignored the fact that decision-making in politics cannot be completely modelled or, even more so, quantified [76 Porter].;N
It was ultimately overlooked that the interaction between state guidance, societal change and the influence of experts – experts such as the Centre Berlin itself – were much more complex than it was possible to depict in a model [91 Seefried, pp 393– 5, 84 Schanetzky].;N
Fundamental problems of the planning department certainly also played a role.;N
The Project Group for Government and Administrative Reform was disbanded, not least due to criticism of the far-reaching planning projects of the Chancellery formed in the Ministries that feared a reduction in their influence.;N
In the cabinet, in which the view of the planning department as a “child’s steam engine” did the rounds, the ambitious Ehmke came under pressure.;N
Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt, an opponent of the planning concepts, prevented a direct coordination of financial and task planning between the Finance Ministry and the Chancellery and, not least as a result of rivalries in the cabinet, Ehmke had to switch to the Technology Ministry in 1972 [47 Jäger, p 33, 95 Süß, pp 369–77, 85 Schatz].;N
It furthermore became clear in summer 1971 that the budget did not offer sufficient funds for all the reform projects that had been drawn up by the Brandt government.;N
The oil crisis of 1973 and the economic crisis then pulled the rug out from under the planning department, as Mackensen].;N
The distancin tion is very apparent here.;N

In the early 1970s, the confidence of many futures researchers in modelling and steering the future was shattered.;N
One reason for this were the outlined problems in utilizing future expertise in government.;N
In general, futures research underwent a tremendous change in the early 1970s.;N
The book “The Limits to Growth” from 1972 epitomized a breakthrough of new modes of thinking about the future, as it conveyed both an “old” belief in computer simulations and global planning as well as a deep questioning of economic growth and technology.;N
Significant sections of futures research came under the sway of an orientation towards ecology and human beings, their needs and values, rejecting a “cool” techno-scientific and “material”-based understanding of progress [96 Seefried].;N
As a result, major strands of futures research in the 1970s abandoned large-scale and quantitative-based concepts of steering the future, developing instead a pragmatic and human-centred approach to thinking about and planning the future.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract This article discusses trust and its evident crisis with a particular focus on the education system (1).;N
Subsequently, the function of trust in the complex knowledge-based society is highlighted (2).;N
Using implementation of evidencebased governance in education as an example, this paper shows how social complexity increases by linking several partial systems (3).;N
This is followed by a discussion of some perspectives on how these combinations can be interpreted with regard to trust (4).;N
Finally, aspects of future theoretical and empirical analysis of trust in applied social science educational research will be outlined (5).;N

The ongoing assumption amounts to a complexity which inhibits both communication and the undertaking of action.;N
Under these circumstances, by directing expectations and attention trust reduces this basic complexity and absorbs uncertainty [ibid.].;N
In the face of deficient knowledge about future events and situations, it enables actors to be confident of success even if there is no guarantee [2: 265].;N
In addition to this, trust also has an affective component and especially an action-related one [3].;N
Trust provides a sense of certainty and creates a sense of coherence, so that communication, decisionmaking and action-taking are possible.;N
This is owing to the fact that trust-givers, despite uncertain knowledge about the future, still assume that their expectations will be fulfilled.;N
Trust is a means by which people can react to basic uncertainty.;N
Due to the unpredictable nature of other’s actions, this basic uncertainty can also take on the form of a danger of failure.;N
This danger can then turn into risk [1].;N
Thus, danger has by no means been eliminated, but becomes limited due to observable, explicit expectations as expressed as trust [4: 370].;N
However in our complex modern society trust between people is no longer sufficient.;N
Instead social complexity can only be sufficiently reduced by trust in the system(s), and more importantly, in organisations.;N
In modern, quickly changing social formations, trust is considered to be the foundation that supports them as well as the glue that holds them together [2, 5, 6].;N
However, international surveys show that the population’s general trust in public institutions is showing signs of decline [7–10].;N
This also applies to institutions within the educational systems: Based on Gallup data, in the U.S.;N

This trust crisis was attributed to the ethnical composition of classes at school.;N

A characteristic society is its differentiatio tems and the increasing int Eur J Futures Res (2014) 2:35 is seen as a system in which knowledge is the central axis of maintaining and developing it.;N
Knowledge is seen as symbolic capital and as an essential resource that enables actors to shape and participate in societal developments.;N
Nevertheless, knowledge is distributed unequally in society.;N
Therefore, in the course of the discussion of the emerging knowledge-based society, discourses about knowledge economy or cognitive capitalism are also raised [29, 32, 33].;N
If trust is seen as Simmel views it [2], as an intermediate state between knowledge and ignorance, it can be regarded as crucial capital that may provide those institutions (which are basically trusted) with room for manoeuvre.;N
This capital allows for opportunities to change plans and tactics which might otherwise remain barred.2 The fragility of trust Trust as a risky means for reduction of complexity The increasing unpredictability and complexity in the knowledge-based society demand an opposite pole.;N
This is why generalized trust or trust in the system (meaning the kind of trust displayed towards experts, people in certain capacities or organisations [35: 84] is seen as one of the constitutive elements of modern society [1, 6].;N
However trust is as fragile as it is essential [1].;N
Trust is essential because it is a fundamental element of systems.;N
It allows things to be done that are seemingly impossible in a climate of mistrust [6: 99].;N
With this in mind, in the following we will discuss the various measures taken to establish comprehensive monitoring circles.;N
This discussion pertains to measures which are presently being set up in the education system.;N
The usefulness and benefit of these measures are still open at the point of set-up, though it remains unclear whether the time and effort invested in setting them up are justified.;N
At the same time trust is fragile.;N
It is easily damaged by dashed Seen from a factual point of form of expectation based information is projected int the present [1].;N

This is because generally measures, organisations and actors are required.;N
Examples of this might be knowledge brokers who act as intermediaries between scientists and politicians, or instruments with which the education system’s capability can be systematically monitored and checked.;N
In terms of reducing complexity by observing others for the sake of finding further justification, mistrust is equivalent to trust.;N
However, mistrust makes successful communication and cooperation with others more unlikely.;N
If trust has been diminished it requires enormous efforts to be regained, as it is a struggle against the persistent tendencies of mistrust.;N
This cannot be achieved without external control mechanisms.;N
However, these control mechanisms inevitably lead to increased social complexity.;N
This will be demonstrated in the following using evidence-based governance in the education system as an example.;N
Henceforth both the linking of the various systems as well as the institutionalization of checkups will be evaluated in greater depth.;N
 Trust and structural linkage It is typical for the knowledge-based society that several societal functional systems are linked [27: 33].;N
In this paper we focus on the combination of education with science and politics in the context of the evolving evidence-based governance in education.;N
The phenomenon of the scientification of educational policies, where governance depends on evidence, is an indication of the linking of subsystems.;N
Further linkages become apparent in the politicization of science, where specific knowledge about education is made available.;N
Science generates instrumental knowledge.;N
On the one hand it is used by politicians to solve problems, as is the case here, in the field of education.;N
On the other hand it can be used to legitimize educational policy decisions as well.;N
That is to say, politics are Thus, not only are they able they also selectively allow other [1: 100 ff.].;N

These forms of socia tion which, seen from a sys used as knowledge for reg these mechanisms generate the trust of all relevant part Theoretical opinions dif Eur J Futures Res (2014) 2:35 according to Luhmann [ibid.: 113], a system-stabilising function: “Whether systems are trusted … may … decisively depend on whether trust is suspended at critical points and mistrust is applied”.3 With regard to trust towards institutions, Shapiro [50] argues that the checks and control of these institutions might set off a spiral of mistrust [ibid.: 652].;N
On the other hand, trust and checks and control are regarded as compatible with each other.;N
Hartmann [37], for example, assumes that those who have trust do not need monitoring and control and will do without.;N
Luhmann [1: 26] says that it is contradictory “to the function and style of trust to demand or offer detailed factual information and expert proof” [see also 4].;N
However, if trust alone is no longer sufficient, and if the complex conditions must be stabilized through checks and control, this kind of dealing with contingency may, in the end, undermine trust.;N
Checks and control primarily do not generate trust, but rather transparency.;N
It is a means of creating knowledge, which replaces trust.;N
Trust changes the focus and directs it towards the instruments of checks and control.;N
How can the structural linkage between related partial systems be upheld under these circumstances?;N
What other informational translations are taking effect here?;N
Problem and solution part II: “evidence-based governance” as generative metaphor In the knowledge-based society, knowledge becomes an essential resource of education governance.;N
At the same time, knowledge is unequally distributed between the conflicting poles of politics, economics and science [51–53].;N
Besides giving educational policy-making this new specific foundation, evidencebased governance also leads to educational policy becoming more scientific.;N
Due to the fact that evidence is processed by the media much more than before, this tendency towards a scientific character corresponds to the communization of decisions.;N
This communication of decisions leads then to specific trust- multiple interpretations, fun connectors in communicat can be regarded as soft go used to try and influence re 141].;N

This makes it rules” [65: 174].;N
It is within neutral methods and instrum [66–68], that political, econ be achieved [69: 75].;N
This ingrained social trust in num 35, Page 6 of 12 carries significant responsibility concerning knowledge and ignorance about the education system and its capability.;N
However, media reports about research results in the field of education are by no means unbiased.;N
Murphy [39], for example, shows how the media influences public understanding of education by their tendentious information about the national examination results in the UK.;N
The media accomplishes this by using a limited repertoire of “structural, narrative and presentation templates” [ibid.: 144].;N
This is problematic especially because “educational assessment results are… a brand which depends very much on the confidence of the consumer” [ibid.: 142].;N
If data is used selectively or manipulatory – whether by the media or politics – it can, quite probably, have an impact on the loss of trust in the education system.;N
In regards to the British school system, according to Mansell [38], it bears the risk that “parents might lose confidence in schools as a result of being misled about what is known about reading standards” [ibid.: 131].;N
It is maybe for this reason as well that public institutions are endeavouring to stabilize the trust in the reliability of their findings about the education system [75, 76].;N
By reverse logic this means if there is no longer trust in the assessment of the education system, it could result in people having no trust in individual organizations.;N
Moreover, the instruments used to gain the results reported in the media and used by politics might lose their legitimacy.;N
To a certain degree, it is suggested that reported results are connected with trust in the education system.;N
This connection between trust and the instruments of new governance can be seen from two different sides.;N
On the one hand, it could be argued that the instruments of new governance are replacing the formerly existing trust.;N
On the other hand, the very fact that new instruments of governance have been introduced may be seen as an indication that trust has been damaged and must now be regained [77].;N
Therefore, trust or rather damaged trust can be regarded as a condition for the introduction of monitoring instruments.;N
Conversely, it can be understood as the in turn will have to be redu mentioned organisations an meant to ensure the credib crease complexity.;N

Along the same lines, Codd [79: 45 ff] describes quality as the metaphor of new forms of managerial control.;N
Indeed, because trust no longer forms the basis of professional ethics, such control is becoming necessary [see also [80, 81].;N
Codd [79: 48] sees the introduction of such instruments and institutions as an expression of “policies of distrust”.;N
Münch [81: 75] also observes that the new governance model “replaces trust with fundamental mistrust.” He goes on to say that bureaucratic regulations are ineffective and expert autonomy is abused.;N
From a functional point of view, trust and mistrust are to be regarded as equivalent i.e.;N
as a solution for the problem of the possibilities of communication, decision-making and actiontaking.;N
This holds true even though the consequences of trust and mistrust are different [1, 41: 85, 82: 290] and can only be assessed as good or bad by their results.;N
Both trust and mistrust are seen as an expression of a “committed attitude” [83], which only makes sense when in connection with the aim to which the actor aspires.;N
The abstract aim of both trust and mistrust consists in reducing the complexity of the social situations resulting from (reflexive) ignorance.;N
Both achieve this by disregarding ignorance.;N
However, mistrust blocks interaction.;N
When this happens people may perhaps look for further information for confirmation, which in turn leads to further blocks.;N
Regarding the organisations responsible for those checks and controls which are trusted, the “amount” of trust they receive depends on their functionality: “Well-functioning institutions need little trust for their stability, while malfunctioning ones need a lot of trust in order to survive”6 [82: 286].;N
In the face of the “evident” shortcomings of the education system, it seems that the education system will require a great deal of trust for its survival.;N
What is apparent though, is an inefficiency.;N
They are cons instruments and rules.;N
How forms to always call for furt complexity.;N
As a consequ reforms makes it very diffic tion that is inherent to the s that the system’s very exi question [85].;N
 Trust and mistrust as two i the coexistence of trust and Trust and mistrust may als occur more or less indepen be assumed that it may b mistrust exist at the same example, if an actor were to services, but might have tru personal “face” of this insti pal.;N
In such a case it is a di call the trust in institutions representatives’ ethical tru focused (rationally) on wh these institutions are follo anchor and is fed by the p perception goes beyond the Starting from the interp public institutions is occu rational trust is decreasing component of trust in insti conceivable that while rati mistrust, ethical trust rema dealings with these institut mistrust.;N
This is why an as hardly be recorded in a me From this point of view t 35, Page 8 of 12 into the trust-seeking systems and must be made explicit, or even be organised there”.;N
Thus, if an erosion of trust has been attested in the education system, checks and control must be installed in order to regain trust or at least to reduce mistrust.;N
This is currently being done through the implementation of new governance instruments in the sense of the “institutionalizing of mistrust” [ibid.: 118].;N
The necessary condition to fulfil this function is that the instruments of institutionalized mistrust – in this case the instruments for generating knowledge about education – are trusted themselves.;N
This leads to our thesis that trust is shifted from the organizations and expert systems to the instruments of institutionalized mistrust trying to observe them.;N
Shifting of trust in institutions towards trust in instruments and the methodological consequences for the observation of these instruments From the perspective of trust theory, the thesis can be proposed that: in the course of the newly ignited discussion about the methods of gaining insight and knowledge that are appropriate to the research object, there is an apparent shift of trust.;N
This shift is, namely,towards the methods and instruments.;N
If, for example, due to negative reports on the capability of the education system, there is cause for trust to be diminished, it seems reasonable that there is a solution to regain or stabilize the now damaged trust.;N
Because trust has been withdrawn scepticism exists regarding the capability of institutions (e.g., concerning the observation of regulations designed to ensure the capability), it seems reasonable that the observation of regulations as well as the performance of institutions should be checked.;N
For this, appropriate instruments need to be introduced.;N
But the instruments, or rather their performance, must also be trusted if they are to fulfil their function.;N
In the discussion about suitable methods and the establishment of organisations meant to regulate the application of governance-gener- models, a turning towards (with their accompanying c nance models) can be also This is especially visible i show an affirmed, acceler based society [79, 81, 88].;N

Against this background, trust was introduced as a phenomenon which plays a central role in dealing with ignorance in terms of maintaining decision-making and action-taking capabilities.;N
Because of its contingent complexity, it reduces the increasing uncertainty found in social situations in the knowledge-based society because of its contingent complexity, which is increasing in the knowledge-based society.;N
In the face of the reported diminished trust in public institutions, which has been reported in numerous surveys, there has been a theoretical discussion on trust in the organisations of the education system has arisen.;N
Trust is a multidimensional phenomenon which is cognitively and emotionally sound and relevant to behaviour.;N
In this paper, the focus has been on the cognitive dimension of trust, within so far as the introduction of instruments of knowledge-based governance as the central point has been in the centre of attention.;N
Beside the temporal and social functions of trust, a particular focus was on the factual dimension of trust, namely the issue of the introduction of evidence-based governance.;N
In this respect we have worked out that in the face of negative education assessment results of education assessments and often correspondingly negative news reports, concentrating just on shortcomings, trust in the education system has been diminished.;N
Although not yet empirically confirmed sound yet, this assumption is plausible.;N
This is due to the perception of the background that the recent introduction of evidencebased governance instruments can be regarded as an institutionalizing of mistrust.;N
The purpose of this introduction of such instruments which is meant to serve to regain trust.;N
We have further worked out that the introduction of such instruments increases the lack of transparency in the system.;N
This opaque quality is the very reason why it cannot help regain trust.;N
This increase in complexity is typical for the knowledge-based society, is plausible in our point of view.;N
This is because the talk about evidence-based governance The theoretical as well shed light on animating th mistrust in modern society.;N

Since futures research is concerned with the investigation of conceivable, desirable and feasible futures, research on integrating trust or disintegrating mistrust fits very well into the spectrum of its relevant and innovative research topics of research.;N

The objectives were to collect perceptions of research needs from key actors i Hungary, to generate collaborative research projects on green care services and to init green care in Hungary.;N
The main research question was as follows: how can we co-cre green care by eliciting responses from concerned citizens and experts in a very open a While a growing body of evidence supports the need for, and benefits of, green care research in Hungary addressing diverse knowledge needs of the multiple social actors Science Café as developed for institutionalising an informal and lively dialogue betwee to be a useful tool to co-generate a research agenda for such a relatively neglected bu theme as green care.;N
 Keywords: Science Café, Science Shop, Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), Gre research agenda-setting Introduction The role of science in society has recently emerged as an ‘old-new’ topic in the European science, research and innovation context.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:5 how can we co-create a research agenda on green care by eliciting responses from concerned citizens and experts in a Science Café setting?;N
This paper reports on our experiences using Science Cafés as a tool to generate a research agenda in a participatory way.;N
Our experience has been gained within the transdisciplinary field of green care.;N
First, we briefly discuss participatory agenda-setting as reflected in the extant literature, particularly in the field of health and environment.;N
Second, we introduce the field of green care.;N
Third, we describe the process for participatory research agenda-setting for green care in Hungary.;N
Fourth, we share our reflections on the experience gained from the Science Café as a participatory research agendasetting tool.;N
Finally, we offer our conclusions.;N
 Participatory research agenda-setting: theoretical and project background Stakeholder involvement and public participation in science in general, and in research agenda-setting in particular, have become overlapping interests of researchers in science policy, health research, public engagement, and the political sociology of science.;N
Co-production and sharing power with citizens in the research process in novel forms resonate with diverse traditions and trends in science.;N
In particular, action research (e.g.;N
[6, 10]), the right to research [3], citizen science [28], and responsible research and innovation (RRI) [20] are becoming the most advanced fields where co-production and the radical democratisation of the research process are most often practised.;N
A range of future-oriented methodologies, tools, and approaches are deployed in this problem space: foresight, backcasting, scenario development, Delphi, trend impact, and horizon scanning (e.g.;N
[18, 21]).;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:5 and responsive to civil society concerns.;N
Within the framework of these new models, InSPIRES partners facilitate collaborative research projects aligned with the principles of RRI, Open Science (OS) and Impact Evaluation.;N
There is a particular focus on health and environmental issues, which are underexplored in the current science shop research agenda, yet can be adequately addressed by strengthening community voices and developing the conditions for a participatory dialogue and knowledge sharing.;N
We now turn to the Science Café as a participatory method of public engagement with science and science engagement with the public.;N
Science Cafés can have multiple purposes and can be applied in different contexts (e.g.;N
[4]).;N
The first series of Science Café events through which our team gained experience was organised between 2004 and 2010 (‘Sustainable Hungary Science Café’), aimed at the popularisation of a sustainability science agenda.;N
In this role, it proved to be a useful tool to engage various publics around urgent and vexing sustainability problems in agriculture, forestry, policy, environment, mobility, energy, gender and politics.;N
Subsequently, two EU FP7 projects (SciCafé and SciCafé2.0) assisted us in understanding the evolution of the Science Café movement and how a previously grassroots movement became a public engagement buzzword (for detail, see [4]).;N
The pervasiveness of participatory engagement in research agendas (multi-actor approach, RRI, Citizen Science) led to a situation where such science-society interactions came to be regarded as almost a necessary step in the promotional cycle of scientific production.;N
The evolution of the Science Café movement has been embedded into the broader context of changing science culture and the emerging practices of science democratisation.;N

Already o of The International Jour ties defined green care as ment with nature in a the Balázs et al.;N
European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:5 as tools of fostering nature connection and ecological thinking (e.g.;N
school gardens, volunteering in nature conservation or organic farming), and (d) green care services as personally tailored, therapeutic interventions for people with defined needs (e.g.;N
animal-assisted therapy, garden therapy, wilderness therapy, care farms).;N
Green care services focus on the changes in people’s wellbeing induced by their connection with nature [15].;N
In western and northern Europe, green care is an emerging phenomenon, yet there is still a lack of understanding of the term [14], there are a few types of research which focus on green care in general, as this concept brings together several academic disciplines across health, environmental and social sciences.;N
Green care typically requires work along the boundaries of environmental and social sciences with a transdisciplinary approach.;N
Within the InSPIRES project, we mapped civil society needs and concerns around green care that contained several empirical steps.;N
Table 1 below summarizes the phases of the research agenda-setting process.;N
In the empirical data-gathering phase, we carried out stakeholder interviews with a sample drawn from our previous contacts, the snowball method and internet search.;N
We conducted 13 expert interviews in total with practitioners in their own work contexts.;N
The average length of the interviews was around one hour.;N
We invited practitioners to describe their experience in green care from the angle that they conceived as most relevant (see Table 2 compiling initiatives and practitioners of green care services, and their specialities in Hungary).;N
We engaged in a discussion of a set of previously identified themes, such as their green care work practices, attitudes towards their clients and the effectiveness of green care services, and expectations After the initial data g views, we selected five th the whole-systems approa the Science Café discussio needs.;N

The common elements of citizens’ and experts’ expectations for future green care services research are a summary of scientific evidence on green care services, methodological handbooks and case study collections including Hungarian green care initiatives, a search for good international practices, promotion of green care services and reaching out to potential beneficiaries, and, finally, monitoring of green care processes.;N
The primary need that emerged is the validation of the impacts of green care services.;N
As a final outreach step, we approached researchers in various fields (medical, psychological) and institutions of higher education in Hungary with research ideas based on this novel agenda, and a new action and research plan was constructed to deploy an impact evaluation process in a Hungarian school garden [16].;N
We paid particular attention to follow-up activities, such as feedback interviews with the invited experts, and podcasts and beneficiaries.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:5 Balázs et al.;N
European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:5 operationalised as an articulated research need.;N
Several research needs were shared by both the experts and the citizens, as enumerated in Fig.;N
1.;N
The participants’ questions were quite technical and professional, more personal questions might have been raised if there had been fewer attendees.;N
From both the citizens’ and the experts’ side, a strong demand for impact evaluation research was apparent.;N
Following upon this particular research need, we have successfully initiated an action research project on impact assessment in a grammar school near Budapest [16].;N
Moreover, we derived new research questions from the contributions and initiated cooperation with relevant university faculties to respond to them, with the inclusion of university students (particularly in the medical and psychological fields).;N
As for the divergent views, the difference is principally rooted in the distinct approach we, as researchers, took to inviting the attendees into the process.;N
In the interviews with experts, we asked them to respond to the following questions: What do they need from science?;N
How can we, as researchers, as scientists, support their work?;N
Unsurprisingly, they gave us mainly researchrelated answers.;N
In contrast, citizens were invited to an informal quasi-scientific conversation, where the terms ‘participatory agenda-setting’ or ‘research needs’ were not explicitly articulated at all.;N
Their contributions related to the specific service the expert presented during the event.;N
Thus, they were interested in the technical details of the therapeutic process.;N
They were also curious about the process by which they could become green care service providers in the future.;N
Every minor decision affected the whole process, from the selection of presenting experts, the way we promoted the events, the venue and dates we chose, the way we arranged the furniture to the manner in which the events service users’ claims, fee about these supplementin believe that plenty of va surfaced, and that we wil search priorities in the sec Conclusion Disconnectedness from interest that has long trad sciences.;N

In particular, that more robust, evidenc would be necessary on th to make their use in healt ommend that researcher case studies, comparative green care service provide shown, knowledge produc but the concept itself still work.;N
The most pressing area of inquiry are all rel of green care service prov Balázs et al.;N
European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:5 and supportive organisations, can successfully enable participatory agenda-setting and research implementation.;N
The main ambition of participatory research agenda-setting—to enable future research and innovation to better align with societal values and demands—is essential to gaining more democratic legitimacy, beyond expert- or technology-driven processes.;N
In the emerging EU research context, participatory agenda-setting is becoming a practical tool to implement RRI, and a possible solution to the challenge of including laypeople in research governance.;N
The main lesson we learned from this process is that a low-cost method like organising Science Cafés can be applied in the prioritisation phase of a research agendasetting exercise in an inspiring and convivial way.;N
As our experience has demonstrated, maintaining relations with social actors and stakeholders remains a crucial challenge for research agenda-setting exercises in the later phases of implementation.;N
Science Cafés with diverse audiences can be particularly useful in seeking more opportunities utilizing meaningful openness and adaptive change in their process to achieve a citizens’ role in coproducing novel and pertinent research agendas.;N
However, our particular experience with employing Science Cafés for research agenda-setting shows that mainly citizens of a particular professional interest (e.g.;N
students, teachers, practitioners) tend to become engaged, rather than citizens with a general interest.;N
Based on our experiences, following the RRI process requirements, it can be seen that it is desirable to involve citizens with experts in a mutually responsive way to map actually existing societal concerns about and knowledge needs for an emerging research field.;N
Sharing and reflecting upon experiences in real-life experiments at the science-society interface is of high significance to all of us in our efforts to enact democracy in science.;N

The complexity of the situation is due to the variety of quantitative and qualitative factors involved.;N
Uncertainty is a key characteristic of our societies, generating fears that must be managed by governments and security institutions.;N
Before defining new policies it is needed an analysis of the current situation of the phenomenon and its possible evolution.;N
Critical thinking, loads of imagination, creative foresight and horizon scanning methodologies would be the pillars of the research.;N
Policies are usually led by events and by social perception of risk.;N
We propose a holistic approach that integrates the lessons learned from the past with modern foresight methodologies, intelligence analysis, evidence-based policing, and decision-making models.;N
It is possible to manage our uncertainties in the present, a time and a matter in which perhaps we feel lost, Terrorist threats in Europ Terrorism in Europe.;N

According to data from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) (April and December, 2013) during the period between 2011 and early 2013 around 140–600 European fighters were displaced to Syria, and in the winter of 2013 this number increased to 1100–1700 individuals.;N
Recent CIA data shows that this number could increase up to 2.000 fighters.;N
Although it is not a new phenomenon, European concern about the foreign fighters is increasing especially because of the threat that the return to their origin places may bring.;N
In this direction we have several signals.;N
One of the last was made by the Heads of State and Governments of the European Union on August 30th 2014, where they show a strong concern about the current situation and “requests the Council to review the effectiveness of the measures and to propose additional action, as required”.1 However, the risk that may involve the return of these individuals to their origin places has not been analysed deeply within Europe [4] only a few researches about past plots exist like Sageman [5], Clarke and Soria [6] or the dataset explained by Hegghammer [7].;N
But still there are not studies on the implications, not only of their “fight”, but also of those who are engaged in recruitment, training, propaganda and communication activities among others.;N
Homegrown terrorism 9/11 led to an unprecedented growth of violent activity inspired by radical Islamism and perpetrated by European citizens’ descendants from immigrants, which have been called the second and third generations, and Muslim converts.;N
Even when domestic terrorism is not a novel phenomenon, the current development of terrorism, especially coming from jihadist roots, has become a weapon of great destructive The European Commiss that are not only led by larg small cells or EU-based gro forms of action.;N
And the res economic damage, these ep encourage extremisms acro affected by global terrorism attacks or perpetrators, recr lone actors.;N

The results of the study allowed confirming the following assumptions: the internet increases opportunities and facilitates the process of radicalization, promotes propaganda and begins to be a great recruitment tool.;N
In addition, UNODC [12] makes a classification of the features that the internet actually provides to promote and support terrorism as a tool for: propaganda (including recruitment, radicalization and incitement to terrorism), financing, training, planning, execution, and cyber-attacks.;N

Phenomena such as the anarchist or extreme right and left groups have international structures, resulting from the strong bonds between the different organizations, but also due to their ability to call to action and act in third states.;N
The impact of terrorist intergroup cooperation International terrorist alliances are a latent threat [14].;N
Their existence contributes to increase opportunities for groups to improve their operational efficiency [15] and lethality [16] as well as it helps them to gain followers, provides a natural bridge for the diffusion of tactical knowledge [17] or brings new funding channels.;N
Ultimately these alliances give them power and ability to act when its structure is limited or threatened.;N
The existence of sanctuaries and safe havens in many parts of the Counter-terrorism measure of the European framework The EU legislative career i seriously after the attacks designed or implemented a whole.;N
However, despite th by SECILE [20] there is stil of all these measures.;N
Early years of EU coun cused primarily on the “pre EU strategy.;N

In the same line it is observed that any urgency to deal with terrorism is performed once its effects are felt.;N
Jihadist terrorism, al-Qaeda, individual terrorism, ISIS, foreign fighters, homegrown terrorism, every “new phenomenon” seems to swallow all previous problems and start to be the importance centre.;N
The problem is when this tendency to act “following news” comes from the field of research and legislation and from the decision-makers.;N

We selected the trends observed trough a literature review process owing to the fact that we believe it necessary to study the phenomenon of terrorism within the social context (with all variables that it entails) in which it runs.;N
Using the same documents and helped by experts meetings in the headquarters of the Centre of Analysis and Foresight (CAP) of Guardia Civil (Spanish Law Enforcement Agency) we identified their drivers (factors that influence or causes change) indicators and those outcomes that could be related to terrorism, that could act as causes or factors, and produce threats and risks, according to the existing lists in “The Routledge Handbook of Terrorism Studies” [23].;N
A trend is a set of processes that cannot be changed easily, a discernible pattern of change.;N
They were born, have been pushed or depend on the present and will continue in the future.;N
A driver is an agent or factor which drive a change forward and the indicators are the different variables that explain it.;N
In our process, which follows partially the model of Lia [33] for the study of the future of terrorism, we have selected political, economic, social, technological and environmental trends, based on the following sources: – – – – – “Europe’s Societal Challenges”.;N

Imagination is not common in bureaucracies.;N
Policy-makers have a short horizon, but policies should not.;N
Some authors highlight the obsession for collecting data [29].;N
The so called “Big Data” is a revolution because it is a source of development that allows managing huge amounts of information and applying predictive techniques.;N
When studying the phenomenon of terrorism or analysing intelligence, this obsession for details can let us know what is going on, but not its causes or the most appropriate measures to be implemented.;N
In the best-case scenario, we can guess that some event will probably happen in the future, or we can compare patterns, but it does not guarantee that the future will be that way [30].;N
In addition, if analysts get used to having every possible detail before making a diagnosis, this might result in an excessive dependence that might lead to paralysis.;N
Unknowns unknowns, a famous concept developed by Donald Rumsfeld, are perhaps impossible to manage.;N
Taleb creates the concept of “antifragility”, a way to manage uncertainty (wild cards or black swans) but not trying to identify them previously, but being prepared to be stronger in this evolutionary and complex system when events with low probability happen.;N
This concept goes over the resilience theories (Wildavsky, Douglas).;N
According to the 9/11 Commission Report “it is therefore crucial to find a way of routinizing, even bureaucratizing, the creativity.;N
These observ the knowledge of rare e patterns of terrorism.;N

A similar model is the one we used in the second epigraph of this paper.;N
Foresight research, papers or books are static information.;N
When we must address risks with rapid change and high uncertainty, the efforts must be continuous.;N
Foresight must be a permanent system because terrorism is an evolutive concept.;N
Trends are continuously evolving.;N
Drivers and indicators need to be continuously evaluated.;N
 Decision-making process Evidence-based counter-terrorism policy is widely understood as a historical search for usable and relevant knowledge generated through rational scientific methods to help address and resolve terrorism-related problems, to produce knowledge required for fine-tuning programs and constructing guidelines and toolkits for dealing with known problems.;N
The centre of policy evidence-based should be to evaluate if counter-terrorism policies work and fix the way we could measure it.;N
But our aim would be broader.;N
It would be, at the end, to design a holistic approach, a model, in order to assure that policing designers had the best knowledge and the best intelligence when they take decisions on counter-terrorism.;N
For this purpose, we distinguish three phases, but each of them is formed by too many processes: a) Before policing.;N
The d the best possible inform fragmented and elabora think tanks, intelligence lobbies, citizens’ desires them.;N
We must evaluate to know if it works, and knowledge and intellige b) Taking decisions or p policy-maker acts.;N

Policies generate effects that must be measured, but not only with rational indicators (arrests, number and cost of attacks, time between attacks).;N
If causing terror is the main objective of terrorism, we should measure fear and terror, and other social impacts of counter-terrorism policies (i.e.;N
loss of civil liberties).;N
This process not only aims to know the effectiveness of the policies, but also to improve future policy making.;N
 A new methodological approach to the study of terrorism and decision-making Therefore, the model we propose, a holistic approach [37], integrates at least five individual models: a new intelligence process, the decision-making process, the “connecting the dots” model of RAND Corporation, evidence-based policing and foresight.;N
The pillars of this holistic approach are: a) Need to focus on intelligence surveys, analyses and actions on answering the question “what for?”.;N
Decisionmaking is the major goal, at strategic, tactical and operational levels.;N
b) The intelligence process must satisfy, as a main objective, the need to “connect the dots”, answering the requirements established to inform the decision-making process.;N
c) The sources of those different “dots” are data, information, imagination and creative thinking, and homeland security observations (i.e.;N
previous knowledge, or intuition based on experience).;N
d) There are multiple stakeholders that could help to create the best knowledge and intelligence in order to take actions, design strategies, or make plans.;N
Think tanks, universities, experts, and citizens should be an important part of that process.;N
It would be useful to integrate the synergies among academic studies about intelligence and terrorism.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Learning strategies are social innovations of the past.;N
To help us cope with problems in the past, they were developed, imitated, spread and codified into practices, rules and institutions.;N
They lose their usefulness if the conditions of the present differ markedly from those of the past that gave rise to the then successful strategies.;N
Our world is markedly different from the past.;N
Thus, we need to introduce new learning strategies to be able to cope with the conditions of the present.;N
And since one key characteristic of the present is a fast turbulence, we need to accelerate our rate of introduction of social innovations.;N
We suggest scenarios as tool to do so.;N

 17 Page 2 of 8 (widespread) adoption ‘social change’.;N
Following Tarde [5, 6], all change starts with the individual and spreads, if useful, through imitation to the society at large.;N
The imitation, Tarde hypothesizes, is not a cloning process resulting in identical duplicates, but a process that always involves variation, thus bringing innovations into social structures and practices.;N
Where the innovation stops and the change starts is a matter of debate [7], but need not concern us here where we examine the contribution of scenarios to social innovation and social change.;N
An acceleration can be achieved in two ways: (1) by empowering individuals to become more socially innovative [8] and (2) creating deliberative processes [4] that in themselves are social innovations, thus speeding up the creation of social capital [9].;N
The hypothesis we wish to test is whether the ‘transformative scenario method’ can be used to achieve both (1) and (2) and thus allow us to cope successfully, even in turbulent times.;N
 Method A strong indication that scenarios are capable of (1) empowering individuals to become more socially innovative and (2) creating deliberative processes that in themselves are social innovations, comes from van der Heijden (as quoted in [10]): BSurvival in a turbulent environment requires a new response based on mobilizing the same systemic forces that generate the turbulent change in the first place.;N
In trying to cope, we must fight like with like.;N
That means that successful coping involves building feedback loops in the environment that can counteract the destructive autonomous loops that cause the turbulence we Translated to the problem calls for a new way to lear ‘turbulent environment’ an that is quite different from t judge whether it makes sen ated creation of social chan method below.;N

Interviews / Conversations To prepare the scenarios, you interview ‘remarkable people’ about different aspects of the driving question.;N
The interviews are open-ended and are more like conversations in which the interviewer speaks very little.;N
The purpose is to bring the full range of concerns, views, hopes and fears of the interviewees with respect to the driving question to the fore.;N
Some points to consider: & & & & & & & & & ‘Remarkable people’ are those who can see things from different perspectives, can verbalize their thoughts clearly and can develop and communicate a line of causal reasoning.;N

Remarkable people need not be experts in their field.;N

Talk to at least three-dozen people.;N
Once the number of conversation exceeds, say, a hundred, the additional insights you gain begin to diminish.;N
The content of the conversations is confidential to all third parties, including those who pay for the exercise.;N
Despite the fact that the conversations are confidential, you should get the interviewees’ permission to record what is being said.;N
This is an effective way of avoiding to hear only what you want to hear.;N

Some points to consider: & & What if small groups come up with 4, 6, 8 drivers?;N
Use inductive clustering i.e.;N
search in the plenary for words and ideas that in the specific form you will be using them, may never actually have been said by anyone of the small groups.;N
What if participants want a third axis in the plenary?;N
Sometimes workshop participants may suggest a third driver, especially after you’ve told them that the drivers will be placed at right angles to each other to create the scenario space.;N
If you allow a third driver, coming out of the flat space (like a z-axis), this creates a sphere, and you have eight spherical segments as homes for the scenarios, bounded each by three uncertainties.;N
The resulting eight scenarios get very difficult to ke ep ap art - we hu ma ns are not go od at distinguishing clearly between so many possibilities.;N
Hence, the restriction to two drivers of uncertainty is a practical limitation to increase the practical usefulness of scenarios.;N
 5.;N
Plotlines The two uncertainties become the axis of the scenario space.;N
Starting at the center of the axis, each of four small groups takes a quadrant and sketches a first story describing that future.;N
They will then work all the way to the edge of the quadrant – i.e.;N
throughout the entire time-space.;N
The groups can either draw a path themselves or have the plenary group suggest one after a group has presented the givens1 – all of they can think of.;N

The second and third routes are the real challenges.;N
They require a keen and truthful understanding of one’s strengths and weaknesses, it also requires a deep understanding of the room to maneuver one has, and it requires the ability to consider the set of decisions one takes as variable.;N
Procedurally, in all three cases you set up a matrix.;N
Do this with the same people that will be taking decisions or are contemplating the social innovations later on.;N
The more homogeneous the group, the easier it is.;N
The homogeneity can come from your age, your field of study, your function in the organization, your interest, etc.;N
The price of homogeneity is, however, that the range of decisions you come up with are often narrower than if you have a few lateral thinkers, a few contrarians in your group.;N
 Adapt Arrange the matrix so that the scenario titles are listed across the top horizontally.;N
Then write down the decisions you want to test against your futures vertically down on the very lefthand side.;N

Start with decisions that are pending or overdue anyway.;N
While writing down the decisions, note that they are independent of the scenarios.;N
They are decisions you and / or your group will take in the here and now.;N
They are your ideas, hopefully informed by robust and challenging hypotheses.;N
They all should be within your, or your groups, power to take.;N
It serves no purpose to contemplate decisions you have no power to take.;N

We also ran two three-day workshops as part of their normal continuing teacher training to give them the necessary practical knowledge, as well as the confidence to introduce a significantly new teaching method to their students.;N
Over the past several years, the approach was used in five schools and in hundreds of school hours.;N
Over 500 students participated so far in subjects like geography, history, religion, information technology and social studies.;N
The feedback from both students and teachers is positive: BBy now, I have used scenarios four times with of various age groups.;N
It is easy to connect this way of teaching to existing curricula and thus easy to legitimize.;N
The students like it and the feedback is continuously very positive.;N
The guide is excellent and very well suited for the practical reality of school life^, report one teacher.;N
An example from a student is BWhat I personally learned from [scenarios] is that I have to be very thorough in choosing my profession, because the future determines my job and my job determines my future.^ Or, another student who wrote: BWe all are somehow afraid of the future.;N
Scenarios are one way to give the fear of what lays ahead a name, and to do something about it.^ In one of the participating schools, the Realschule (junior high school) Baesweiler, scenarios are now mandatory in social studies.;N
In all of them, scenarios teach students a set of skills that enable them to create maps of the turbulent future for themselves.;N
This works best in situations where the maps of the future have a direct relevance to the lives of the students, as is the case, for example, in their choice of career.;N
Additionally, we have found that creating scenarios teaches several key competencies that normal classroom interaction rarely does.;N
These are personal competencies, like ethics, respect, self-reflection, making plans for your life and self-expression, social competencies like verbalization, solidarity, control, criticism, conflict management, listening scenario imagined ho coming decade from 1 Ostrich told the sto government, sticking i ly in vain) to avoid a n majority.;N

They were empowered to actively make use of the future, rather than passively endure it.;N
Recall the student who wrote, BWhat I personally learned from [scenarios] is that I have to be very thorough in choosing my profession, because the future determines my job and my job determines my future.^ Whether participating in scenario processes resulted in the students being more likely to initiate social innovation is too early to tell.;N
We are examining this aspect of scenario work in another, still ongoing, project with Syrian refugees in Sweden, where we try to measure this impact with the help of a questionnaire modelled after Aizen’ theory of planned behavior [8].;N
We will report on the outcome in due course.;N
The work did result in a small social innovation: In the social studies department of one school, participating in scenario work is now compulsory for all students.;N
Whether this social innovation, by way of imitation [5, 35] or otherwise, will result in social change remains to be seen.;N
In the second case, the Mont Fleur scenarios, social change was created through the social innovation of using the scenario process as a deliberative and cooperative way to reach agreement.;N
Up until then, the change from white-only rule to majority rule was often accompanied by violence and civil war.;N
While it is very difficult to assign a direct causality to the benign effect of scenarios, Trevor Manuel, the Minister of Finance in South Africa and a Mont-Fleur participant, credited the process with playing a significant role in the country’s economic and political transition.;N
BIt’s not a straight line from Mont Fleur to our current policy,^ he said in 2000.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Background During recent years, questions of quality and good practice gained more traction in the European futures studies community.;N
For this reason, the organizers of the international conference BFutures Studies Tackling Wicked Problems^, held in Turku, Finland, in June 2015, decided to devote one of the fifteen thematic sessions to methodological issues with a special focus on quality.;N
This session was jointly organized and chaired by the authors of this introduction.;N
It comprised six sub sessions with a total of twenty papers presented: introduction, critical assessments of futures research methodology, methodological challenges of participatory futures research, methods for security focused futures research, methodological challenges in business foresight and methodological challenges of regional differences.;N
The common motivation behind the methodology sessions was to debate the state of the art of futures studies, standards for that futures researchers use other branches of research, discuss basic concepts and basis for a specific scientif research.;N
For that purpose, article^ [14] that the mag 2015.;N
The speakers of the vited to read the Futura ar it was discussed in the firs sion.;N
The speakers were their presentations or link of the speakers also comm This topical collection discussed during the Turk adapted to integrate comme the conference.;N
Some pap publication deadlines and this collection covers rathe 21 Page 2 of 10 the future(s) map.;N
First of all, this concerns various scenario approaches that are compared with the Futures Map [15].;N
In his remarks and commentaries, Osmo Kuusi motivates and illustrates the Futures Map frame and the quality criteria defined within that frame.;N
He also comments other articles of the Topical Collection and presents some ideas concerning the ways that might improve validity evaluations based on the suggested Futures Map frame.;N
The papers in this Topical Collection discuss quality criteria of futures research or foresight from different points of view.;N
It is possible to characterize these perspectives using the main categories of the quality criteria suggested in [15].;N
On the one hand, quality criteria might concern (1) futures research or foresight process (internal validity), (2) its results (external validity of the Futures Map) or (3) the use of the results (the use of the Futures Map).;N
On the other hand, you can discuss quality criteria on different levels: (a) on a basic philosophy level, (b) on the level of pragmatic general criteria and (c) on a special context level.;N
The paper of Anna Kononiuk and Anna Sacio-Szymańska [9] discusses quality criteria of foresight in the business environment focusing on the poorest part of Poland: Podlaskie region.;N
The quality criteria discussed in the article concern mostly foresight process in the special business context (1c).;N
The focus of the interest of the authors was also the use of foresight results in companies (3c).;N
First of all, the study by Kononiuk and Sacio [9] describes how foresight is used in Podlaskie region companies.;N
Further on, it discusses the actual or possible benefits of foresight for the companies.;N
Based on the results of an empirical study of Rohrbeck and Schwartz [21], the authors conclude that the formalized process of foresight might increase the ability of Podlaskie companies in detection, interpretation and reaction to unprecedented events and trends.;N
Foresight might also improve the ability of organizational learning.;N
Only large companies in the Podlaskie region have some the advantages of that coa fectiveness of entire comp making process and more Quality in this regard is foresight studies in term impact on organizational The article of Vasamo cusses quality criteria in a the Radical Technology I oped in the Committee fo liament for technology fo account the impacts of em Vasamo uses systemati matic external validity c gested by [15].;N

quality criteria first of all o Referring to Longino [ can provide two different is the objectivity that is bo truth and referential chara Eur J Futures Res (2015) 3: 21 The foci of Kosow’s [10] paper are two basic scientific quality criteria of scenarios: consistency and traceability.;N
Traceability of scenarios is often discussed under the terms of transparency, explicitness, accessibility, documentation, and also reproducibility.;N
The reproducibility criterion discussed by Kosow has common and differing features than the informal reproducibility criterion introduced by Amara [3].;N
As Kuusi will discuss further below, Amara’s futures research frame can be seen as a forerunner of the Futures Map approach.;N
The main contribution of Kosow’s paper is the many-sided discussion concerning the consistency criterion.;N
According to Kosow, consistency is a safeguard against arbitrariness of scenarios.;N
It is a substitute for empirical validation, which according to Kosow is not possible and not appropriate with regard to scenarios as their object is not accessible in the present and as they do not claim to be or to become true.;N
As a scenario construction principle, consistency is a kind of heuristic that forces the scenario builder to reflect, how ‘bits and pieces’ are brought together to form scenarios.;N
According to Kosow, internal consistency refers to the question whether an individual scenario is consistent within itself.;N
Consistency within a scenario sample (or scenario set) refers to the question whether all scenarios of one sample are consistent with one another.;N
The third type of consistency is the consistency between different forms of one scenario, e.g., between a narrative and a numerical form of a scenario.;N
Fourth type is the consistency of underlying models.;N
In the Futures Map frame, the consistency and traceability criteria belong to the pragmatic external validity criteria of the Futures Map.;N
In our classification, they belong to the group 2b.;N
In summary, the papers of this Topical Collection provide many insights into important aspects of quality criteria.;N
Taken together, they could contribute to establishing the scientific identity of futures research as a discipline in becoming.;N

In the field of business management, Donald Heathfield [5] has had a similar interpretation of his Future Map.;N
He combined the Future Map with the concept of the future Bevent field^.;N
According to Heathfield [5], the Bevent field^ is the picture that appears on the collective Bfuture radar screen^.;N
A field of anticipated events could be built for any domain or entity, be it an enterprise or a country (Fig.;N
1).;N
The goal of the Future Mapping process is to create the event field and then continuously question and clarify this picture using all means available.;N
Like the row variables of the Futures Table, the factors in Heathfield’s event field describe the relevant dimensions of the future developments.;N
The rows of the Futures Table have, however, another highly important function.;N
The alternative values of row variables open up a rich view on alternative developments.;N
The often-used Strategy Map based on balanced scorecards is the third example of a future map based on exosigns.;N
The Strategy Map aims to make the future relevant beliefs of an organization or of its management explicit.;N
In the case of the Strategy Map, the mappers and the customers of the map are the same though typically facilitators from outside the organization participate in the mapping process.;N
Like the customers of the Futures Map of Kuusi et al.;N
[15], the developers of the Strategy Map use the map for the promotion of their vision.;N
According to Kaplan and Norton [8]: B[S]trategy maps […] give employees a clear line of sight into how their jobs are linked to the overall objectives of the organization, enabling them to work in a coordinated, collaborative fashion toward the company’s desired goals.;N
[…] Strategy implies the movement of an organization from its present position to a desirable but uncertain future position.;N

Key customer understand and An early author who ha with the validation approac Eur J Futures Res (2015) 3: 21 [V]alidation akin to that of scientific prediction (or hypothesis testing) is not appropriate, then what kind is?;N
Validation must be used in the sense of demonstrating that the links between available information and forecasted outcomes are plausible.;N
Plausibility does not mean predictability.;N
The most useful indicator is not necessarily whether the forecast was on target […] but whether the forecast meets proximate and internal validity criteria.;N
Though Amara did not use the map metaphor he realized that the validation should be based on the plausibility of various paths of the future.;N
Like in criteria 3 and 4 of the pragmatic external validity above, he considered that the validation should be based on the links between available information and alternative future developments.;N
He introduced the interesting concept of the reproducibility that connects the plausible possible futures and past facts.;N
Amara [2] also nicely discussed the relevance of the futures research effort to its customers, which is the basic feature of the six pragmatic external validity of [15].;N
Like criterion 1, he also asks: Is the purpose [of futures studies] to provide images of the possible?;N
For futures research, it has been, however, a great pity that Amara started his article with the thesis: the future is not predictable [2].;N
I consider that this slogan parroted by many futurists is misleading because it does not take into account both stable and instable elements of the future in the proper way.;N
More suitable thesis is the following: we can predict the future only if we know causal processes that define the future.;N
As is discussed below, this formulation is better in line with Amara’s reproducibility criterion as well as with the Futures Map frame of [15].;N
According to Amara [2], the background of his reproducibility criterion lies in sciences where experimental results are repeatable within a given measurement error.;N
A particular set of inputs operating within a reasonable controlled environ- are typically known.;N
Typica behavioral patterns, you are tions concerning its behavio predictions of the future ap of the technology.;N

According to Amara, if the focus of a study is on the probable, the futures researcher should answer the following questions: 1) Is the output repeatable under same conditions?;N
2) Is the output reproducible under different conditions?;N
3) Is the output consistent as different assumptions are used?;N
The Consumer Guide does not make any distinction between not-learning and learning systems.;N
However, you can guess not-learning systems through the criterion that Amara suggests for the evaluation of the possibility of a future image: the image should be within bounds of known physical principles.;N
Amara considered that the second basic criterion of the possible image of future or scenario is its internal consistency.;N
Kosow [10] has extended the consistency concepts to concern also consistency within a scenario sample (or scenario set), consistency between different forms of one scenario and consistency of underlying models of scenarios.;N
The consistency concept of the GTC is still more general than the concept of Kosow.;N
Kosow [10] and the GTC share the interpretation that the perception of the consistency is a subjective matter.;N
According to Kosow, scenario storylines rely on holistic consistency ‘filters’, as intuitive gut feelings, i.e., subjective consistency definitions.;N
In the GTC, the perceived consistency depends on the subjective criteria of sameness of the actor.;N
The further advantage of the GTC is that it compares the learning (the change in the subjective criteria of sameness) and the perceived inconsistency - for example the unexpected event - to each other.;N
Unlike learning beings or actors, notlearning beings behave consistently following their invariant criteria of sameness.;N
The other basic difference is that Kosow [10] explicitly excludes from the scenario consistency dimensions ‘consistency with current knowledge’.;N
For the learning would follow any scenario the preferences of its custom tion of those scenario paths Surely, the preferences of th Futures Map define these c tomers are especially impor is on the external validity cr customers (criterion 5) or possible (criterion 1) or we on 3), the values and prefer so important.;N

The context is also related to the most challenging wicked problem of the human kind: the climate change.;N
 Futures maps focused on the criteria 1 and 3 Like the geographical map, the Futures Map is a tool for decision-making of its users.;N
A key challenge of both the geographical map and the Futures Map is the balance between the rich description of the landscape and the simplicity of the map that makes its use easy to the customer(s).;N
The richness of the Futures Map is the special target of the first and the third criteria of the pragmatic external validity.;N
Using the concept of Ackoff [1], their main function is to avoid the omission error.;N
The omission error is one formulation of the so-called third kind of error in the statistical inference.;N
In the statistical inference, you make the acceptance error if you accept something that you should reject (the type I error).;N
The type II error is the rejection error.;N
You do not accept something that you should accept.;N
In the Futures Map frame, you make the type I or II error if you wrongly either add or reject to add a hypothetical scenario path to the futures map.;N
Using the metaphor of the geographical map, your Futures Map has a type I error if it includes a path that in practice is not available.;N
It has a type II error if your Futures Map does not describe a hypothetical path that is available in the futures landscape.;N
Ackoff [1] suggested that mistakes of omission are much more serious than the acceptance or the rejection errors.;N
In the futures map frame, the omission error means that you omit possible scenarios or use irrelevant formulations of futures related research questions.;N
Using the geographical map metaphor again, your Futures Map describes for example just paths The consistency require well as above concerns als from the point of view of re Futures Maps focused on th cerns often the capacities of no driving license, to drive In the morphological matr pairwise consistency evalua tics of the key factors relat from 1 (not conceivable, to perfect match) (compare [4 Futures Maps focused on A key question concerning is how to take into account cy is mentioned in all six validity and it is especially and 6.;N

That is why to anticipate of wild cards you need to select experts carefully, who are ready to discuss the developments on the long run.;N
But like Shala [23] warns you should be careful with the Binformation policies^ [11] of experts.;N
Amara [2] considered that the informational reproducibility or the probability of a scenario is strongest when different individuals using different methods or models produce this scenario.;N
The Strong Prospective Trend (SPT) [18] is a approach, which follows this recommendation.;N
The SPT describes a future development that on the one hand is the continuation of some past trend.;N
On the other hand, an expert panel evaluates that the trend will continue.;N
The strength of the concept of the SPT is that you can even in quantitative terms make more reasonable probability evaluations of future developments than just using trends based on the past statistics.;N
If actors or representatives of actors are participants of the expert panel you can also take into account their preferences.;N
It is also possible to inform the expert panel about causal links between futures relevant variables based on the past data.;N
In that way, you can really integrate the quantitative past evidence and the qualitative expertise.;N
A suitable frame for the use of the SPTs is an Argument Delphi study [11].;N
The crucial feature of the Argument Delphi process is facilitated anonymous argumentation between experts.;N
The size of the panel is 15–40 persons.;N
The prerequisite of the successful Argument Delphi process is the carefully selected panel.;N
Any panelist should give a special contribution to the study based on his or her special competence and role as the representative of a relevant interest group.;N
The first round of the Argument Delphi is typically based on the interviews of the panelists.;N
The half-structured interviews motivate panelists to invest a lot of effort to the written comments of the next possible wild cards.;N
This i tool developed by the com of their tool is that if some cific development and do no see the judgments of other cial information concerning the realization of the possib the best experts according Map.;N

The trip business as usual scenario other option that belongs t question is: how long shoul to justify the conclusion th longs to the Futures Map Eur J Futures Res (2015) 3: 21 geographical map is not just a detailed picture of the ‘futures landscape’, but a working tool for orientation in the futures landscape.;N
A map too detailed of all kinds of possible future paths might be also a too complicated tool for orientation.;N
First of all, the Futures Map is a tool for orientation of its key customers.;N
The key customers should understand the language or key metaphors of the Futures Map.;N
Sometimes a key customer might even require the use of a ‘code language that some other actors do not understand.;N
This is a possible situation concerning the Futures Maps that are focused on criterion 6 but not on criterion 5.;N
On the other hand, if the Futures Map focuses especially on criterion 5, its basic challenge is to use the language or signs that lay people can understand.;N
A high quality Futures Map in criterion 6 and especially in criterion 5 avoids the information overflow.;N
How to avoid information overflow?;N
One possibility is not to include into the Futures Map scenarios or pictures of the future that get low probability or informational reproducibility [2] evaluations.;N
But as stressed in validity criteria 1 and 2, this is a questionable choice because some what-if scenarios or scenarios that explain past weak signals might anticipate important wild cards.;N
A better way to avoid information overflow is to include only those scenarios into the Futures Map that provide information that otherwise may be missed.;N
In other words, you do not evaluate scenarios separately but in the context of all presented scenarios.;N
In order to communicate relevant information with few scenarios, you can use two approaches that complement each other: the principle of the maximal difference and the choice of the most relevant among similar scenarios.;N
The first step of many scenario processes was the construction of two divergent or contrasting scenarios, assuming that the likely future would be somewhere between the two.;N
This application of the principle of the maximal difference was used already in the famous Shell 1973 scenarios.;N
Having this closest contrasting scenario velopments that are close Does a new scenario or p content to the Futures Ma we add the new scenario to away another scenario from mation overflow?;N

In the futures map context, we can give the following interpretation to the compromise effect.;N
Two scenarios are combined to a new more relevant scenario.;N
For example, the traveler has sometimes used the bicycle and sometimes walked to the railway station two kilometers away from his home.;N
The personal trainer includes a new option to the Futures Map, in which the traveler uses the bicycle for the walk to the railway station.;N

The lifetime odds of dying in a motor vehicle accident in the USA has been estimated at 1 in 114, which is high compared to, for example, air transport accidents (1 in 9821) [1].;N
Young people are overrepresented [2], making road traffic accidents a large societal problem in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).;N
Compared to technical failures, human failures are a much larger contributor to accidents [3], human errors (e.g., inattention, loss of control) and violations (e.g., excessive speed) both contribute to accidents [4–7].;N

From Kooij et al.;N
[16] In this paper, we argue that the data that are recorded by automated vehicles have additional potential to contribute to reducing the number of traffic accidents.;N
In order for their potential to be unlocked, these data will need to be shared beyond the vehicle itself so that they can be used to analyse the how, where, and who of road traffic errors, violations, and accidents.;N

2 Possibilities for giving real-time feedback if an automated vehicle detects a a hazard or b an inefficien Above, we used a fatal accident to illustrate opportunities for data sharing.;N
Similar opportunities exist with any recorded aberrant behaviour that results in a near miss or inefficiency.;N
Besides automatically issuing a horn sound as mentioned above (Fig.;N
2a), the vehicle may signal “Go” to make a traffic situation more efficient (Fig.;N
2b, see also [22]).;N
In summary, if sensor data were shared (either wirelessly to scientists and technology developers, or directly to other road users), the how errors and violations lead to accidents would be elucidated, the development of automated vehicles would accelerate, and road safety could benefit.;N
The sharing might concern the aetiology of accidents, but could just as well be extended to non-hazardous-but-inefficient road users’ behaviours.;N
Where do errors and violations occur?;N
 The identification of accident hotspots is traditionally done based on historical accident data.;N
Sensor data by automated vehicles can improve the identification of with video observations to roundabouts with and with Additionally, if road aut locations are prone to er possible to warn drivers i ring a traffic location tha example, current route n ning sounds regarding th and accident hotspots [2 violation-prone locations floating car data could be including specific informa and violations occurring sections where drivers dr exceed speed limits).;N
In summary, data sharing ding of where road accide could allow for a smart red personalised warnings to n de Winter et al.;N
European Journal of Futures Research (2019) 7:2 factors: Some drivers may never be involved in an accident, whereas others may be involved in an accident due to bad luck (e.g., another driver running into them, a slight lapse of attention which is unrelated to more invariant personal characteristics).;N
However, simulation studies and empirical data suggest that if enough accident data are collected, individual accident occurrence data are reliable, with stability correlations up to r = 0.8 [32, 33].;N
This finding indicates that some drivers are more accident-prone than others.;N
Next to accidents, drivers’ behaviour also appears to be stable.;N
For example, in his work “Fast learners: once a speeder, always a speeder?,” Groeger [34] found medium-to-high stability coefficients of driving speed (r between 0.2 and 0.8).;N
Transmission of data collected by automated vehicles creates several opportunities for preventing accidents before happening.;N
In particular, it becomes possible to keep track of who makes errors and violations.;N
If automated vehicles are equipped with identification features (e.g., licence plate recognition), the aberrations of other vehicles can be automatically recorded in real time.;N
Moreover, if the identification software allows for facial recognition, it will be possible to record the behaviour of non-motorised individual road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motor riders.;N
Shanghai police uses facial recognition to identify cyclists who cycle on the wrong bike lane [35, 36], and in Shenzhen, facial recognition is used to catch jaywalkers [37] (and see O’Malley [38] for a review on the technological and societal bottlenecks of “telemetric policing” techniques).;N
The recording of errors and violations allows for calculating a person-specific “violations score” and “errors score.” For example, a cyclists’ violations score could be defined as a composite of how often he or she runs a red light and ends up in dangerous encounters with data from November 201 the Netherlands already o velocity, accelerations, an plugged into the ODB po dicated that pay-as-youinsurance can lead to a re (e.g., [47]).;N

Are car drivers willing to upload their data to the cloud, and do they accept that these data will be stored and used by automotive manufacturers, governments, and researchers?;N
In other words, are drivers willing to make utilitarian decisions, if it may not be beneficial for them individually and even if it could make them liable in case they violated the rules or cost them insurance premium?;N
Will automotive manufacturers, OEMs, and other stakeholders who wish to use personal data collected by automated vehicles need the consent of the users/customers for doing so?;N
Fundamental differences between Europe and the USA with respect to data ownership and data privacy will further complicate data sharing [53].;N
Privacy issues will become especially severe when driving skill and driving style indicators are intended to be combined with other databases, such as databases of crime, tax income, or even polygenic scores [54] (and see [55] for an overview of possible behavioural biometrics).;N

 Is it legally possible and ethically acceptable to issue fines to or revoke driver licences of drivers based on their high accident proneness (i.e., a statistical index of risk)?;N
How does this differ from relying on overt behaviours only (i.e., speed or headway), as it is currently done, considering that in both cases an inference is made regarding whether a driver is a danger on the roads that could cause an accident in the future?;N
 If a person’s violations and errors scores indicate that it is statistically likely that this person will be involved in a future accident, should a licencing authority suspend one’s driver’s licence, and should a transportation company find a replacement job for this person merely based on a statistical probability rather than a committed aberration?;N
How does this proposition differ from current laws according to which a driver’s licence may not be issued or renewed in case of a medical condition that is likely to impair one’s driving ability or in the case of a “negligent or incompetent operator” [57]?;N
 As automation will become increasingly safe, information regarding unsafe manual driving could be used to enforce automated driving in specific conditions.;N
However, the question is should all violations and other illegal acts be prevented?;N

While increased connectivity creates ample opportunity for making use of the data collected by automated vehicles, these opportunities involve privacy-related ethical concerns and may, therefore, face backlash from the public.;N
A common principle is that it is not ethically acceptable to implement and enforce systems that disclose the identity of individuals, especially when this disclosure concerns behaviours that conflict with societal and legal norms.;N
On the other hand, this principle may have to be adapted if this could pave the way towards collective benefits such as greatly improved road safety.;N
Here, one may wonder whether it is ethically acceptable to have over one million annual fatalities worldwide due to road accidents.;N
Co-standardisation of safety and security requirements, for example, by combining information security standards (e.g., ISO 15408, ISO 27001, ISO 27002, and J3061) with the automotive safety standard ISO 26262 [67], will be needed to mitigate cybersecurity risks (e.g., data tampering, hacking, fooling sensors) and convince users that their data are handled in a responsible manner.;N
Business models that advance consumer empowerment may also play a decisive factor in users’ willingness to share their data [68]: users appear to be more open in data sharing if they get benefits in return, such as financial compensation and personalised services [69–71], and when transparency and perceived justice regarding data collection, management, and processing are high [72, 73].;N
Secure data privacy models, transparency of data exchange, and control of third-party access are important solutions for exploiting data while at the same time complying with privacy laws [74, 75].;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Contemporary visual artists from Turkey, who have left their ‘home’ for various reasons, such as migration or education, have emerged as a distinctive voice on the contemporary European art scene.;N
What makes these artists pertinent for an analysis of new forms of identity and citizenship making, and the negotiation of belonging and mobility in contemporary Europe is that their art presents the sheer diversity of artistic approaches that address, incorporate, and fold cultural interaction as well as confrontation with the identitary and cultural ‘container’ that is Western Europe.;N
This paper will focus on three cases, Nevin Aladağ, Anny and Sibel Öztürk, and Nilbar Güreş, querying whether and how their artistic gaze can provide critical insight into the diverse possibilities of relations between Turkey and Western Europe.;N
Using their works as laboratories or ‘snap shots’ of identity negotiations, this paper will query how mobility and transnational encounters shape artistic production, and how, in turn, such transnational and intercultural works can shed new light on the mak- Introduction Recent years have witnesse a number of international a and exhibit their work, m experience of homeland, m Kitty Zijlmans notes, thes vacuum in the art world, f connected to the country of their alleged original cultu contemporary visual artists for various reasons such emerged as a distinctiv European art scene.;N

Officially starting with bilateral recruitment agreements in 1961, the influx of guest workers was initially a business transaction between states, which originally aimed at recruiting a foreign work force for Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands for a limited period of time with the notion that they would be ‘guests’ and eventually return to their country of origin.;N
However, this ‘transactional migration’ in post-war Europe transformed all the countries involved economically, politically, socially, psychologically, and artistically as the duration of stay went beyond the desired period, and as the ‘guests’ brought over their families, and settled in their new ‘homes’ [3–11].;N
What is of specific interest is how migration with its results as a social and economic phenomenon has recently been represented through the prism of contemporary art.;N
Both migration and artistic practice are far from a uniform or evenly shared experience.;N
Therefore, I would like to focus especially on three cases, coincidentally all female: Nevin Aladağ, Anny and Sibel Öztürk, and Nilbar Güreş in order to present their artistic gaze into the diverse possibilities of European identities and their implications.;N
How do their transnational experiences affect the art practice?;N
Can artistic production be a form of individual emancipation?;N
How is cultural confrontation translated into an artistic interpretation?;N
What is lost (or gained) in this ‘encounter’ and how does art become a reflection of mobility and belonging?;N
These questions are intimately linked to the experience of migration both on an individual level, as well as a part of a larger cultural ecology with its aesthetic, artistic, social, economic, political, and transformative dimensions.;N
What the chosen artists hold in common is the fact that while they might otherwise have remained ‘invisible’ or have been categorized as ‘other, work- Furthermore, as Arjun Ap Modernity at Large, migr products create what he te the production of modern examine in this article can this new, ‘unstable’ order, calls Bdiasporic public sphe ories that depend on the con as the key arbiter of import artists become representativ they initiate a constellation order.;N

She gracefully ‘folds’ numerous matters into her work.;N
Aladağ delegates her performances, and often they are ‘acted out’ in terms of popular cultural practices related to group identity, such as those of migrant communities or social class or both at the same time.;N
Urban space is what interests Nevin Aladağ in her work—as a space for negotiation and representation of different agendas, as a space full of traces and poetry, and as a space where the individual and community meet up over and over.;N
In this spirit, her performances have been staged on streets, in apartments, on a roof, and in a Berlin courtyard.;N
As an image of close co-existence, the courtyard can be viewed in general terms as a micro-unit of public space.;N
Taking this as her theme, Aladağ went on walks in Berlin (2009), Vienna (2010), and Hamburg (2010) to research her performance Hochparterre (Mezzanine) (Fig.;N
2).;N
It takes place in the courtyard of Naunynstrasse 27 in Kreuzberg, the district with the most culturally diverse popu- Fig.;N

Hochparterre does not try to take the community as a referential social entity.;N
What it has done is to reveal the impossibility of community and the impossibility of total consolidation, wholeness and unity.;N
Aladağ’s work reminds us that the postcolonial subject is not simply a way of representing difference but a process of negotiation in which self and experience are never totalized and always ongoing [15].;N
The result is a multi-vocal and multi-layered poetry of the city, in which the spectator, actress, and generators of the original soundtrack become actors of a play centered on authenticity and reality.;N
The various answers given by the participants (living in the neighborhood) form an examination of the possibility of drawing boundaries and designating identities, creating a new encounter and cocktail of dissonant, at times, contradicting voices without unifying these contradictions into a harmonic and nostalgic picture.;N
Who lives in the neighborhood?;N
Are they glad they are there?;N
What do people think of each other?;N
Hochparterre presents the answers, because it invites the street itself to speak.;N
The performances in Berlin, Vienna, and Hamburg reflect the real conflicts of (in this case) German-speaking neighborhoods facing issues of the foreign, the new, and change—as well as revealing secret desires and unexpected viewpoints.;N
Those interviewed all speak their own words, but their polyphony is edited into a single entity.;N
By projecting subjectivity onto a multiplicity of voices, processes of identity formation—based on experiences, encounters, wishes and desires, achievements and plans—are renegotiated within a social context.;N
In her performances, Aladağ creates artistic frameworks for experience that reflect and dramatize aspects of the structures and conditions which form personalities and communities, raising questions that unsettle and intrigue, confuse and texts on the walls (speaking south, the sea), this story among the Gastarbeiter (re)creation of an annual jou Through this work, the Öz into a collectively shared e experience and memory int Although Behind the W work created by the daugh ception as the two sisters A different (hi)story.;N

Through their work, we can see how migrants transform geographic and cultural boundaries, how such ‘travels’ potentially change and challenge presupposed understandings of identity.;N
Nilbar Güreş Nilbar Güreş is the third example through which we see how the Turkish artists work with their own image, and their perceived image: a meta image.;N
Güreş (born 1977 in Istanbul) lives and works in Vienna and Istanbul.;N
Her biography is relevant here as she moved from Istanbul to Vienna in 2000 at 23 years old.;N
She received her BA in Painting from the Faculty of Fine Arts, Marmara University, Istanbul, and then completed her MA in Painting & Graphics from the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna.;N
As an artist who got her preliminary artistic framework and education in Istanbul and later in Vienna, her work is inspired by her daily experiences and observations [17].;N
She works with various media including drawings, collages, objects, videos, photos, and public space performances.;N
Nilbar Güreş’ first video works, Soyunma (Undressing) and Yabancı (Stranger) (both from 2006), deal with women, identity, and dress codes as they relate to issues such as nationality, ethnicity, and class.;N
Stranger is composed of four videos that are three minutes each.;N
The focus will be on the first and last videos that make up Stranger.;N
The first video, Person of Cloth (Fig.;N
3), depicts a woman on the Vienna subway wearing a blue and red floral print that totally covers her face and body, topped by a black headscarf with embroideries on its edges (worn in the style of villagers in Turkey).1 As the camera shows both the protagonist and the wagon that she is in, we see that she is sitting with her legs crossed in the Fig.;N

 3 Page 6 of 9 As Claire Bishop notes: Artists choose to use people and themselves as material for many reasons: to challenge the artistic criteria by reconfiguring everyday actions as performance, to give visibility to certain social constituencies and render them more complex, immediate and physically present, to introduce aesthetic effects of chance and risk, to problematize the binaries of live and mediated spontaneous and stages, authentic and contrived, to examine the construction of collective identity and the extent to which people are always exceed these categories [19].;N
In her current practice, Güreş uses fabric in a myriad of ways from her collages to her videos.;N
The fabric has a twosided mission, both of veiling and revelation.;N
The textile that covers her in the video, also makes us wonder how claustrophobic and breathless she must be underneath it, with no open hole in the textile the artist is completely wrapped in it.;N
As Güreş covers herself, she uncovers a silent prejudice.;N
It is not only the fabric that covers her body, but also a social fabric, as dressing and undressing are fundamentally codes.;N
Maybe not only undressing herself, but most importantly the desire to undress the male hegemonic system in Turkey, and at the same time undressing and unpeeling the ‘Turkish image’ in Europe.;N
Turkey’s patriarchal rigidity seems to be covered in the soft textile.;N
The softness of the textile becomes a buffer zone of flowery textile against patches of incomprehension [20–22].;N
Can art express the residue of various influences on the maker, including displac emen t or mobility?;N
Autobiographical account is often part of the artwork, and the border between the artwork and the artist’s biography becomes fluid, hence we might speak of a new kind of authorship, intimately related to the artist as an individual, but also mediating between home and abroad—and thus fundamental in the re-shaping of identities.;N

There is also the added layer of how she feels the western European gaze on herself.;N
How there are certain expectations that are created and how they are not fulfilled.;N
She focuses on criticism of social gender as well as identity politics, fluid identities, social imagination, cultural isolation, the perception of women, their presence and absence in the public arena.;N
The sections of Stranger video address moments of social exclusion, looking at the self-image of the excluded and the way that this distorted perception of the self contributes, in turn, to a deepening sense of not belonging.;N
She creates ‘faceless others’ in willful passage or forced transit.;N
But as people are blind to her she is blind as well, as she cannot see or encounter their reactions.;N
Güreş’ work is (literally) multi-layered.;N
There is the context of mobility, which rises on two levels in both of the videos.;N
The artist’s own practices of travel have informed her work, and within the work, the mobility of the subject is central.;N
Her migration as an artist is integral to the work she produces.;N
Her travels have informed her identification of her initial subject, her consequential choice of art forms, and the means of dissemination of the ideas they present.;N
For Güreş, mobility is framed through specific social and spatial contexts.;N
Also by using the medium of video, her work articulates video’s most significant characteristic as a moving medium, in the triple sense—the moving image, the movement of the people, and the emotionally moving quality of the interaction, or in this case, lack of interaction, and recognition.;N
Güreş uses the medium of our time, video, which is also the medium of time—of time manipulated, offered, and layered.;N
Migration is also an experience of time—as multiple, heterogeneous.;N
The time of haste and waiting, the time of movement and stagnation, the time of memory and of unsettling present not sustained by a predictable future.;N
The phenomenon Mieke Bal calls Bmultitemporality, the experience of it, hetereochrony^ [24].;N

The living currency of her work is her body as she turns herself into a moving object in order to reject and claim certain identities and prejudices along with issues of difference, openness, tolerance, and knowledge.;N
Güreş, as in her other works, departs from personal observations, the question of whether anything can be done, and the desire to trigger social change.;N
She also presents the polarities of individual/ collective, author/spectator, active/passive, domestic/public, real life/art.;N
The collaborative play before the camera results in a precise measuring out of the maneuvering space of identity, of ideas of the ‘own’ and the ‘stranger,’ as well as of the cultural shaping of images.;N
Transgressing regimes and tactics of visibility in public space, Güreş, makes them visible and up for discussion.;N

 Instead of a conclusion 4.;N
 What brings these three female cases of Nevin Aladağ, Anny and Sibel Öztürk, and Nilbar Güreş together is the fact that first of all, these artists are not rejecting or erasing the contexts, and instead, they are taking and using their background, feelings, experiences, and encounters as the source with which to create both an individual as well as artistic means to first engage the viewer and to challenge the doxa on a transnational level.;N
Artists have become observers, and willingly or unwillingly, postulants for a redefinition of the dynamics that drive the society at large.;N
Displacement or migration, conditions that provide a niche from which to address issues of identity as well as belonging, challenge inherited notions of home, territory, and ethnicity in a world that is constantly shifting.2 Hence, the trajectories of this select group of female artists involve not just a rethinking of the Turkish artscape, but also 5.;N

Young Abstract It is a general observation that foresight is analogised with forecast.;N
Yet foresight, or futur or deterministic.;N
The misperception appears to be based on the belief that foresight doe results that are immediately applicable within an executive or policy decision arena.;N
unfounded on reality and thus not relevant to fast tempo or strategic level operation the use of evidence-based methods allows foresight work to be immediately operati Using a case study of nuclear weapon security within Pakistan, this paper explores th thinking, scenario development and options analysis to develop plausible, feasible an options.;N
The case study demonstrates that it is possible to develop quantifiable optio foresight methods.;N
This paper argues that useful foresight needs to be tangible and Keywords: Systems thinking, National strategy, Scenario development, Security polic Introduction Drawing from a multi-discipline perspective, this paper describes a novel methodology for developing evidencebased, actionable strategic options.;N
The use of evidence is intentional as one of the perceived problems in using future methodologies is that they are often difficult to trace or have an inadequate ‘audit trail’ ([1] p.;N
8).;N
That is, when presenting the findings of a foresight-driven forecasting.;N
That is, they a describe the possible futur cles, the majority appear ment methodology [4, 5 foresight [6] or establishi [7].;N
Some even look at t [8].;N
While useful, as they knowledge, there appears Young European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:10 this article illustrates how multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), risk analysis and stakeholder analysis allow us to understand which options can be considered to be desirable to the decision maker.;N
Background problem and method The problem example used in this article is derived from the 2009 book 7 deadly scenarios: a military futurist explores war in the 21st century by Krepinevich A.F where a crisis in Pakistan is described ([9], p.;N
30).;N
This article assumes a position that represents the interests of the National Security Council (NSC) of a small to medium size western nation in the region.;N
The NSC requires immediate strategic options that are actionable and are capable of furthering their interests in the region.;N
In short, the background is: The situation in Pakistan is deteriorating rapidly as the threat presented by the break-away Islamic Army Faction (Islamists) and associated Militant/Terrorist groups (Militants) increase.;N
The Pakistan government is no longer functioning in its normal state and, as a consequence, the internal stability of Pakistan is wavering.;N
The majority of the Army is loyal to the government (Loyalists) and has control over most of the country however is under constant pressure from the Islamic Faction.;N
Additionally they have lost control of several nuclear warheads and are unsure of their locations.;N
Fortunately all of the conventional delivery systems are still controlled by the Loyalists although it is possible to convert the missing warheads into ‘dirty’ bombs.;N
The international community is observing and reluctant to interfere.;N
This is due, in part, to the inability of most nations to contribute sufficient forces to have an impact on the situation in draws from the syste model and simulate t of this step is to und environment that can change.;N
This will be the use of stock and 3.;N

 There are a large range o this step and can be, adm of this process.;N
The thre this process are trend ana some sort of morphologic are a set of scenarios, and can be influenced by the security apparatus.;N

For instance, F3L2I5M3N3S3 would describe a world where Pakistan is starting to collapse due to emerging Islamic threat and the loss of nuclear weapons.;N
In this case, this is the starting position of the scenario narratives and the foundation of the problem being addressed by the NSC.;N
Because there are over 5000 potential scenario narratives, an internal consistency analysis reduces the possible scenarios down to a more manageable number ([14], p.68).;N
Finally, we can, through the combination of ‘like’ worlds, develop a list of 12 possible worlds (Table 2).;N
These worlds are then placed on a timeline in an attempt to understand logical changes and possible outcomes.;N
The result of this process is illustrated in Fig.;N
1.;N
Here, we can see the development of three distinct end-world and the potential scenario paths.;N
Aside from creating a very simple illustration that is easily described to decision makers, descriptive narratives can be created.;N
For instance: Table 2 List of the final 12 worlds after congruence analysis and combination of like worlds Letter Combination Explanation P Pakistan is starting to collapse due to emerging Islamic threat and loss of nuclear weapons F3L2I5M3N3S3 1.;N

1 The development of three scenarios using FAR this allows decision makers to quickly identify ‘decisive’ points and also establish concrete goals.;N
For instance, if the preferred future is scenario F, then a loyalist-supported stability is required (World S - F4L1I5M1/3N1/3S1/2).;N
Unfortunately, this is the point where most foresight practitioners stop.;N
While these scenarios are a useful starting point, they still do not tell the decision maker (the NSC in this case) what their feasible action set is.;N
FAR (along with most scenario development methods) does not provide probability.;N
 Step 2: What is probable?;N
 Understanding the probable requires a good sense of the government, an increase i ical system and a decrea recruits.;N

Timing of International Intervention—If an intervention is left too late, such as when the Loyalists are ineffective, then the success of such an intervention is highly unlikely.;N

Importance of the security of nuclear weapons—The main incentive for the major powers to intercede in Pakistan is the security of the nuclear weapons.;N
As soon as it is evident that the nuclear weapons are unsafe and not controlled, then a rapid response can be expected by the international community (particularly India and US).;N
4.;N
Flow on effects—It is important also to understand the order of the flow-on effects.;N
In this situation, most of the problems stem from the strength of the Islamic faction.;N
By immediately reducing this factor, most of the other factors start to normalise.;N

 While a relatively simple step, the development of a set of feasible options is one of the most critical points in this process.;N
Up to this point, we have been exploring the operating environment.;N
The next step is to create a number of actions that can influence that environment.;N
In order to create a limited number of strategic options for the NSC, the Threats-Opportunities-WeaknessesStrengths (TOWS) technique was used ([14], p.;N
92).;N
The TOWS is a reverse of the more commonly used SWOT.;N
While the SWOT is more recognisable, the use of TOWS is very deliberate.;N
While using this methodology, we have found that people who use SWOT appear to be more internally focused.;N
Conversely, the key advantage of TOWS is that it examines the external environment (threats and opportunities) first.;N
This ensures that the final options are responsive to the environment.;N
Hence, TOWS is recommended over SWOT.;N

Fortunately, individuals within a group will often diffuse the responsibility and are more likely to take risks—thus, it would be fair to conclude that NSC is more likely to take a risk than not [22].;N
Before the decision is placed before the government, there is still a requirement to ensure that the presented options would rate well against the preferences of the interested parties.;N
This is a process called congruence analysis.;N
In our case, we are looking at proposing a limited intervention to support the Loyalists (or future F4L1I1M1/3N1/3S2).;N
Table 6 illustrates this technique.;N
This quick test demonstrates that a limited intervention that moves Pakistan from F3L2I5M3N3S3 to F4L1I1M1/3N1/ 3S2 is well in line with the preferences of both interested parties.;N
The second test is to ensure that Intervening Government has the resources to undertake the chosen strategy.;N
This combines the actions developed earlier with the change from current to preferred world as illustrated above.;N
Table 7 demonstrates a resultant ‘gap’ indicates the ease of transition for Intervening Government.;N
It can now be seen that there will need to be a number of investments to ensure a successful strategy.;N
For instance, a major investment into the use of Special Forces (SF) to locate nuclear weapons is needed as it is critical to success.;N
Fortunately, some of the actions, such as “Lobby UN in support of intervention”, already have sufficient resources to complete the action.;N
Finally, we can recommend to the NSC that option B is immediately recommended due to low risk, low cost and high benefit, however, option A should be supported and pursued in the longer term.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Social sciences are experiencing an anticipatory turn.;N
A core issue of this turn are the so-called ‘weak signals’.;N
In order to speak of this type of signals, we must use the distinction between weak and strong.;N
The question may be raised, who handles this distinction?;N
That is, who is the observer?;N
It seems that only two answers are possible: the observer is either outside or inside, i.e., either he is a worldobserver, or he is a extra-world-observer.;N
In the latter case, the problem of weak signals disappears, after the fact, everybody is able to say BI told you!^.;N
In the former case, the system has to face the dilemma of warning signals.;N
As social systems cannot observe themselves from the outside, the issue of weak signals should be explained as the outcome of a selfreferential dynamics that finally leads to the paradox of knowing the unknown.;N
In fact, the difference between weak and strong refers not to the future as such (to what is signalized), but to the observing system itself.;N
The main hypothesis of this contribution is that a signal is weak for a lack of redundancy Keywords Anticipation .;N

On the other hand, sc anticipation is a neglected tention.1 However, the antic be observed also from the s 4 Page 2 of 13 behaviour^, on Bmore future-oriented planning^ in decisionmaking processes (especially in formal organizations) could be regarded as a consequence of the social transition from a closed future to an open future.;N
This temporal change implies the relinquishment of an ontological representation of time.;N
In Stoicism, what-will-be is already what-it-is, although men can neither foresee nor predict the future.;N
Since future cannot be foreseen, it is meaningless to anticipatorily worry about what could be and could be not.;N
Thus, true certainty is the absence of cares (sine cura, that is, without concern [about the future]), and only men who are not in need of future and do not reckon their time-to-come are truly virtuous.3 In the mid-17th century, time-consciousness is radically different.;N
Future does not exist because it has no being at all.;N
Future is simply a Bfiction in the mind^ ([8] p.;N
10): the observing system can construct such a fiction all over again because time-to-come never becomes present.;N
‘Open’ future means that observers can figure out a set of rival hypotheses, which has space for residual hypotheses [9].;N
The function of such residual hypotheses is to mark the unpredictability of future events which observers attempt to control through decisions.;N
One of the main results of this temporal habit is that modern society has an only seemingly contradictory relationship with uncertainty.;N
On the one hand, it regards uncertainty as a fundamental resource for decision-making.;N
On the other hand (and in sight of decisions to be taken), it regards uncertainty as a problem to be solved.;N
However, the awareness lies in the background that without uncertainty it would be impossible to take a decision.;N
Indeed, in the Middle Ages uncertainty had already been regarded as a resource that could offer some advantages.;N
The main argument was produced by theology, and dealt with the difference between time and eternity.;N
Because of certainty (securitas), men are lazy and prove ungrateful to the Lord.;N
By contrast, uncertainty (sollicitudo) reminds men that the providence, and regard Gesellschaft^ (insurance-so This reappraisal of unce attributions.;N

In § 4, I try to show that this signalling system is more complicated than signals, which steer the systemic coupling with natural environment because society behaves as a historical machine.;N
Such behaviour implies that both system and environment behave ‘anticipatorily’.;N
Thus, anticipation becomes reflexive and second-order anticipations arise from this type of reflexivity.;N
The main hypothesis of mine is that environment is what is not anticipated when a system tries to anticipate the environment.;N
In other words, systems behave in an anticipatory manner because the environment cannot be anticipated.;N
Being operatively closed, the system reacts to its own anticipation of the future rather than to the future as such.;N
On the basis of these rather abstract assumptions, in § 5, I will return on the topic of weak signals moving from an empirical case study: the signals of an economic upturn in Italy.;N
By means of this example, I introduce the idea that in modern society one of the most successful anticipatory systems is statistical probability.;N
This calculus does problematize and de-problematize the future, consequently, it offers a ‘substitute for certainty’ that can be exploited in decision-making processes.;N
In § 6, finally, I deal with some recent developments of the idea of weak signals in the sociology of organizations.;N
This discipline introduced successful concepts into the scientific debate, for instance, ‘vulnerability’ and ‘resilience’.;N
The provisional result of these sociological surveys is that the true problem actually is that the observer doesn’t know that he doesn’t know.;N
Social systems try to cope with this secondorder ignorance, or ‘super-ignorance’, when they address weak signals.;N
As a consequence, current society is living in a condition of ‘chronic fear’.;N
In fact, I feel that in society every signal should be regarded as a weak signal, unfortunately, this conclusion jeopardizes the usefulness of the distinction between weak and strong.;N

Past and future are simply constructions continually reproduced by an observer who is embedded in the current present (in Shackle’s terms, in the ‘moment-in-being’) and deals with provisional memories and expectations.;N
Under these circumstances, any decision depends on the future that one would like to realize, whereas in turn future (intentionally and not intentionally) depends on the taken decision.8 The decision-maker is aware that it is not his attempt to plan the future by means of rational foresights that changes the circumstances, rather it is his attempt to realize the plan, i.e., the taken action, that changes the circumstances under which the (foreseen) future will realize.;N
Consequently, the situation is undecidable.9 These different temporal approaches affect the type of orientation one is searching for when he is dealing with an unknown future.;N
In this respect, divination had developed very clever techniques to producing information.;N
The basic assumption was that, whereas gods have certain knowledge of visible and invisible events, men have to search for clues and conjectures.;N
These clues (in modern terms, these weak signals) could be found in nature or intentionally produced by men.;N
In both cases, they required a special art of interpretation.;N
Information production could not be performed at will.;N
Artificial divination provided a Bprocédure expérimentale méthodiquement organisée^.;N
Obviously, the purpose of such procedure was not to set observers’ minds at rest by means of a certain knowledge of future.;N
Artificial divination produced sentences and conjectures that should be in turn interpreted.;N
Consequently, that opacity (that ‘weakness’) that divination should in principle eliminate was introduced into the world again even if with a different shape ([25] p.;N
36, [26] p.;N
23).;N
The advantage of this unusual procedure was that observers had a relatively transparent technique for dealing with future opacity.;N

To worry about weak already know that they sign a catastrophe or a disaster Eur J Futures Res (2016) 4: 4 In modern society, which is obsessed by the need of dealing with an open future, uncertainty is a resource but also a problem for every decision-making process.;N
And every decisionmaker must address the circularity of temporal references that turns any present into an undecidable situation.;N
However, this undecidability is the essential condition that makes a decision possible [28].;N
In other words, if future could be decided, we should simply wait that the decided future eventually occurs.;N
There would be no decision any more that could be taken.;N
Every type of action could no longer affect the future that ineluctably unfolds itself.;N
Social reality would turn into a deterministic machine.;N
On the contrary, if future cannot be decided we are able (and compelled too) to take decisions whose outcome cannot be fully predicted.;N
Every decision-maker is therefore coping with an unpredictable future that depends on predicting decisions.;N
To start a decision-making process, the circular relationship that links future and decision must be first of all turned into some kind of viable circularity.;N
This transformation is possible if, for instance, an asymmetric distinction is introduced.;N
The latter does not remove the self-referential circularity, it rather enables the observing system to gain at least some information [29].;N
The distinction between strong and weak is just an example of this type of asymmetries.;N
This distinction refers to the observer rather than to the observed reality, and marks the ignorance which the observer has to cope with when he tries to get some bearings in the opacity of the time-to-come.;N
In other terms, what is weak is the attention paid to the signal rather than the change in the situation that was signalized.;N
As a consequence, the circular self-referentiality of observation does not turn into a tautology.;N
In this respect, Ansoff himself had distinguished future uncertainty into an uncertainty which preserves a certain continuity compared with the past and therefore enables observers to estimate historical regularities, and an uncertainty which, on the contrary, is characterized by discontinuities and can become a threat or an opportunity.;N
Ansoff’s firm belief was time-to-come, it is clear th future to see what is going o he found.;N

This empirical assu mation value of an environ 4 Page 6 of 13 information.;N
From this standpoint, signal is a difference for information processing.;N
Without a difference, indeed, nothing can look like a selection and be thus information.;N
Moreover, the information value of an event depends on the selectivity of selection.;N
Such selectivity, in turn, depends on the number of possibilities, that is, the variety that a system can deal with.;N
For instance, to guess the name of a person is much more informative than to guess his or her sex.;N
Hence, not only observers depend on information, but also information depends on observers.;N
In other terms, information is never transmitted by the environment, rather it is Bgenerated by observers^ ([38] p.;N
658).;N
This condition also goes for signals.;N
A red light is informative for the one who just got the driving license in a different sense compared to the one who is working in an industrial plant.;N
In everyday life, this is almost a truism and can be learnt very quickly.;N
What instead is often neglected is the highly selective nature of signals that process information.;N
Structural coupling itself cannot take into account everything is occurring in the environment, otherwise system should address an information overload.;N
Rather, systems balance high irritability with high indifference.;N
Signals focus system’s attention on environmental events which could have a surprising effect for the system, simultaneously, they distract system’s attention from other events which are not taken into account and could become a second-order surprise.11 Technology and the use of computer hugely increase the irritability of social systems, so they help (if not even substitute) perception in many fields.;N
Nowadays, no one would take the control of the danger of volcanic eruption seriously by looking at rising smoke.;N
Technology provides society with a highly complicated and opaque system of technically controlled indicators.;N
As always in the case of structural coupling, these indicators increase the structural uncertainties which the operationally closed communication system has to cope with.;N
These structural uncertainties do represent what might be beginning (or the end) of th running back to me.;N

The true question rather is on what is based the credibility of a warning signal.;N
As any structural coupling, also warning signals imply the simultaneity of system and environment.;N
The paradoxical effect is that the efficiency of signals depends on the impossibility of verifying their efficiency, as Lars Clausen and Wolf Dombrowsky clearly proved.;N
Also, we should remind that warning against risks implies the risk of warning.;N
As the lacking of warning signals makes it impossible to react to threats by means of prompt remedies, so the excess of alarm can produce a tailing-off of attention (as those who live on the volcano slopes know very well), or the loss of credibility of the signal itself (the ‘crying wolf’ mechanism).;N
In addition, there is the well-known danger of self-fulfilling prophecies: warning triggers the catastrophe which one would avoid simply because it has been communicated ([45] Ch.;N
13).;N
 Anticipatory systems in anticipatory environments The question could be raised BHow is it possible that an event is understood by social systems as a signal of an impending change?^.;N
The systemic coupling with natural environment is relatively less complicated compared with the systemic coupling with social environment because nature usually behaves as a trivial machine.;N
Otherwise, there would be no pharmaceutical industry.;N
In the social world, the interpretation of signals is more complicated because society usually behaves as a historical machine.;N
To disentangle this complexity, we shall return to the idea of anticipation.;N
The principle of operational closure does not admit that the system can anticipate its environment, and this is also true when the environment is conceived as future threat.;N
Such misunderstanding is the result of a thick description made by a third party who describes the interplay of system and environ- inside the system.;N
Such rebeen distinguished16 enable lack of operational contact means of internal performa the environment, the syste over the environment.;N

If we th operational closure, the qu 4 Page 8 of 13 level, we know that some hormones trigger enzymes that behave for organisms as ‘predictors’ of future developments, so the organism can get ready to anticipatorily react to these changes.;N
Those who take part in conversation act ‘tactfully’ if they anticipate the reaction of communication partners to their utterance, for instance, by avoiding embarrassing questions [50].;N
Anticipatory systems of this type are regarded as intelligent systems.;N
In turn, intelligence may be regarded as an anticipatory performance based on systemic behaviour.;N
Indeed, it is possible to ask the question BWhose anticipation?^.18 But also BWhat is actually anticipated?^.;N
If we take into account what has been said so far, it is clear that the only answer consistent with a constructivist approach is that systems can anticipate their environment since the environment let itself never be anticipated.;N
Or in simple terms: when it is performed, anticipation is always a future-referred present operation.;N
If future could be anticipated, there would be nothing more to anticipate, eventually, nothing more to do.;N
Systems do not react to the future as such, they rather react to their own anticipations of the future.;N
Every policyholder is well aware of it.;N
When he seizes the opportunity of taking out an insurance, he anticipates the possibility that the premium can be paid in vain if the claim that he was afraid of or had calculated in advance does not occur.;N
In social systems, the situation is very complicated because social systems usually behave as a historical machine.;N
Every field map, like a financial model or rational forecast, changes the field (i.e., the reality as such) that is mapped for the simple reason that it is communicated, thus making the same map somehow unreliable [52].;N
Moreover, every map, just like every distinction, has no real correspondence in the external environment.;N
This basic condition (in usual terms, the map is not the territory) does not exclude that a map may be very fitting and successful, for instance as a field map of an organization.;N
However, the transitory success is not due to the map as such, it is rather due to a transitory behaves in different manne ety changes recursively wh pared with the available sys relationship between input on past.;N

F with a moving object, or it it can learn to the extent t disappointed expectations Eur J Futures Res (2016) 4: 4 the environment.21 The reaction is efficient if triggering is highly selective.;N
The hypothesis of self-referential systems theory is that this selectivity is conditioned by external references.;N
In other words, when the reference to an environmental event can trigger the systemic self-reference again, the system can selectively combine the recollection of past experience and the expectation of future events.;N
In this very case, we can say that the event performs a signalling function for the system.;N
The purpose of the well-known research developed by Pavlov on conditioned reflexes was, in fact, to understand how it is possible that a whatever environmental event can perform a signalling function and trigger an anticipatory behaviour in a cognitive system.;N
System’s performance (its ‘intelligence’) can be explained by means of the distinction between event and structure.;N
Whereas events mark irreversibility, structures mark temporal reversibility ([54] p.;N
73 ff., p.;N
389 f.).;N
The system can quickly react to an event that appears and disappears, and quickly forget what happened.;N
In this case, the systemic behaviour is very similar to the model (environmental) stimulus/ (systemic) reaction.;N
Or, the event can make tracks in the system, which thus reacts more slowly [55].;N
An association of ideas arises which coincides with a peculiar systemic expectation.;N
Indeed, expectation has no duration, whereas the perception of duration is the outcome of an expectation.;N
The expected event is (and remains) uncertain, whereas the expectation of such an event provides the system with a relative certainty, which is used to get some bearings in an environment that remains unforeseeable.;N
An event is a structuring event if it can change systemic past, thus binding the way the system get ready to react to the future.;N
In other terms, if it can shape the way the system recursively combines self- and external reference.;N
Since they are based on expectations, system’s orientations may also fail.;N
Expectations can be not only confirmed but also disappointed.;N
Pavlov’s dogs can be easily defused if no food is contrary, social sciences sp this is subject for another r Warning signals in soci The reasoning developed so return to the main topic of moving from an empirical published in 2015, Luca R spread by the Italian Gove recovery.;N
On the basis of d first 2 months of 2015, the signals of an upturn in econ first 2 months of 2014, the a had been 112,000 unities 2 months of the next year which implies a 35 % incre spoke of an Bextraordina accelerazione^) of employ year.;N

In a sense, we could say that past is of no importance – if social systems produce discriminations, they do that by means of self-referential criteria as, for instance, examination in educational system or general election in political system, for sure not because of familiar membership or gender distinctions23 – and this is the reason why past is so obsessively calculated.;N
From numerical clusters, and – as Ricolfi’s article clearly demonstrates – from comparisons between numerical clusters one can mine information that can be used to cope with complexity rather than to forecast a future which in spite of everything remains unpredictable [59].;N
Statistics has another advantage: it offers a type of ‘secondary normality’ that explains the deviation in everyday life as a normal event ([15] p.;N
1).;N
Thanks to statistics and statistical probability, the oddity becomes credible that also contingency has its own order, that is to say, that there is some regularity in random distributions and that such regularity can even be calculated.;N
Those who go beyond the limit of disbelief can use the regularities of chance as rules for decision-making.;N
Obviously, this does not imply that one has the certainty of taking the right decision, as gamblers know very well.;N
What can be achieved rather is a sort of ‘substitute for certainty’ by means of which one can plan actions, figure out short- or longterm strategies, and make profit, as the existence of insurance companies actually demonstrates.24 However, reckoning does not eliminate dangers in everyday life, and does not give any information on the single case.;N
The average of car accidents does not inform the policyholder whether or not he will be involved (whether or not insurance is profitable).;N
Nonetheless, it can justify a risky decision that remains right also when it eventually proves to be wrong.;N
Consequently, the calculus of probability problematizes and de-problematizes the future that the calculus itself pretends to anticipate.;N
It problematizes future because it calculates what indeed cannot be calculated – which is better than fatalism, in improbable outcome if futu been calculated), so the pr shall address in order to co how different.;N

If the experience accrued by social studies on disasters is generalized, the real problem seems to be that the concerned system (for instance, a formal organization) doesn’t know that it doesn’t know.;N
The ignorance which social systems are addressing is not simply a first-order ignorance, that is, I known that I do not know.;N
In other terms, the matter is not simply that information is still lacking.;N
The situation is even worse because nobody really knows which lacking information will be more relevant in the future.;N
The observing system is addressing a second-order ignorance, or ‘superignorance’ ([68] p.;N
5 ff., [69] p.;N
93): it doesn’t know that it doesn’t know.;N
So, if the debate on weak signals always contains the latent question BWhy did you not know that you didn’t know that you didn’t know?^, the only answer one can give is BJust for this reason^.;N
In this very sense, the idea of weak signals attempts to symbolically hide the paradox of (lacking) information on the lack of information.;N
The second-order ignorance is a consequence of the fact that the blind spot, which is embedded in every observation, cannot be eliminated, even when the observing system performs reflexivity.;N
The problem of uncertainty becomes autological.;N
The matter is not simply that future is uncertain.;N
The observer also addresses the uncertainty of the uncertainty that he is addressing by means of anticipatory performances.;N
After a disaster, the meaning of anticipation can be retrospectively re-constructed.;N
Right now, the observer understands that he did not know that he did not know.;N
In other words, he understands that in his expectations there was a void.;N
Facing a so complicated situation, scholars look like resigned.;N
On one side, formal organizations legitimate their decisions by acknowledging in advance that they do not know which outcome these decisions will have [70].;N

Empow Introduction In this study, we present a design experiment accomplished in textile teacher education at the University of Helsinki.;N
The experiment showed students the connections between understand the opportunitie and discoveries.;N
The object materials using different t enhances free and unconve The purposes of future 18 Page 2 of 10 Futures studies propose the active role of a person for exploring and imagining the future [2].;N
And from this point of view craft provides an interesting field of approach.;N
Craft offers opportunities to experiment with new ways of thinking that break the boundaries.;N
Craft makers and designers ought to have a key role through which they can innovatively renew their practices and also actively influence the public and the future in society.;N
Future-oriented craft education increases understanding of the effects of design on people and the environment and encourages rebuilding the living environment and its products and services.;N
[3] This agrees well with the most general and important purpose of futures studies which is to maintain and foster the freedom and well-being of humankind and all living beings.;N
[1] Education is preparation for the future.;N
It is guided by the partly unknown skills and abilities that will be needed in the future.;N
According to Hicks, teachers generally deal with the present and explicit exploration of the future is missing from the curriculum.;N
In times of transition and rapid change, the past cannot provide an accurate guide to the future.;N
Students need to develop skills in anticipation and adaptability, foresight and flexibility, innovation and intuition in order to become more adaptable and proactive towards change [4].;N
Also important are students’ real-life experiences that shape their capacity to acquire knowledge from past experiences to shape future experiences [5].;N
The purpose of design education is to guide the student to a critical approach and to increase the proportion of knowledgeable designers, craft teachers and consumers who understand their environment and culture [3].;N
Design education encourages experimentation, initiative, perspective change, and sharing one’s own ideas.;N
In addition, the idea is to make design thinking and the design process as a tool for phenomenon-based learning.;N
It is impossible to answer the future challenges of craft and design by developing only the old ways of working.;N
It seems that working in the conventional way is a strong habit, with a fully acknowledging imagi ist aspects of design [9].;N
Within art and design ed terials is an integral part of attention to materiality in e limited.;N
Related studies [10 sketching, novice designers three-dimensional materia et al.;N
discovered that des forms may start from sketc when developing the idea fu sidered materiality importa cating ideas as it provides a develop the ideas further.;N
[ Ugly, crafting and disco Currently, ugly seems to be the contemporary craft an For example, new emergin pear in unconventional shap combinations, intentionall chaos.;N

From our experience students usually wanted to Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 18 ugly, its options for exploring what students knew or did not know, or what they should learn.;N
The ugly experiment gave students an opportunity to become familiar with learning by discovering.;N
In discovery learning, the learner feels something new as personally meaningful and interesting.;N
Open-ended creative tasks are not yet everyday practice in the education of crafts.;N
[17] When students have opportunities to get the experience from open design tasks, they can gradually develop the ability to deal with uncertainty and produce creative solutions.;N
In the feedback discussion at the end of the course, we discussed whether teachers educate students to do things ‘right’ and perhaps even to think that there is just ‘one right way’ instead of many alternative ‘right’ ways.;N
We as teachers had a good reason to start thinking about what students could learn by doing things in wrong and ugly ways.;N
Would the doing wrong and ugly help students to get rid of old, familiar routines in craft learning?;N
Would doing things wrong enhance students’ learning compared to doing things right?;N
As futurists have argued, people are often bound to their conventional way of doing and fail to see the possibilities for change within themselves.;N
This is because most of them have not been taught to look at the world unforeseeably and search beyond the cultural conventions and manners of their own groups for possibilities for their personal futures or for society’s future.;N
[1] Research aims, materials and methods In this study the research questions were: 1) How does ugly appear?;N
2) How has ugly been refined during the process?;N
3) What meanings and interpretations applied to ugly?;N

The summary of the experiment built on the theme ugly smell and taste - and also thoughts, feelings and memories, relevant to the situation.;N
One student recalled children’s ability to test everything with their mouth and tried to make form and structure with a piece of chewing gum.;N
The use of chewing gum in this way was also a ‘wonderfully naughty act’ or an attitude against appropriate education.;N
However, the knowledge of the flexible and sticky nature of chewing gum was not enough or was not helpful when used as a tool for creative work.;N
 realized by dyeing, or in w replicated.;N
 The pattern applied on the paper with Hubba-Bubbachewing gum is ugly.;N
It did not turn out the way I thought or felt in my mouth (Table 1: Picture 1).;N
 The materials did not b result seemed unpleasant student’s mind.;N
Moreover, It was difficult to estim dyes certain intermediate the result was always so peared different in dye l pared a perfect dye liq appeared dull and greyis Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 18 I put the assisting material [interfacing] on the top of the fabric, not under it.;N
I used leftover yarn and did not iron the work at all.;N
And I left it unfinished.;N
I used zigzag stitching everywhere, not just at the edges of the fabric.;N
And I don't like zigzag at all.;N
The students had different ways of starting to work.;N
For some students, the design process proceeded so that they began to work on the first idea and used it as if it was the root from which all the developments would come.;N
Other students, in turn, were looking for numerous initial ideas by developing and cross-refining them.;N
The students often began to implement the first idea to generate good, useful and practical outcomes.;N
Some students rejected the experiment, because they could not generate any ideas from it or see its utility for solving a design problem.;N
They regarded it as unattractive, and as a result it was not expected to be or become ‘anything’.;N
Conventional thinking and customary habits may lead people either to reject ideas almost automatically, or to hesitate in expressing them.;N
People do not wait until the vague representations trigger mental images and suggest new ideas.;N
Instead, they tend to utilize exemplars that first come to mind or use the most representative feature of a source even when encouraged to produce novel ideas [18].;N
 Ugliness and learning When the students developed the task further, they needed to analyze their experiments more carefully in order to see the outcome in new ways.;N
The students started to retrieve problems and answers together via experiential-verbal reflection, reflective observation, and sharing experiences with others.;N
This study showed that especially at the beginning, it was not easy to talk about highly personal experiences, partly ideas from others as well a ries that added motivation.;N
In the experiential-verb quite subjective and caused the students learned to criti without using only value w present opinions of success ments, it was possible to n discussions with someone work.;N

It was possible to terials and colors during ex terials.;N

Last ti felting brought nice me 18 Page 6 of 10 beauty as it highlights beauty’s special qualities [15].;N
For example, a student transformed a vomit she saw in front of the apartment building’s doorstep as a starting point.;N
After several sketches and visual works, it turned into something beautiful and the origin disappeared.;N
Students also noticed the transformation when they were evaluating their own experiments.;N
The yarn ends were just a scrap of rubbish, ugly looking, but still at the same time they looked beautiful.;N
This yellow wool-iron-stuff is ugly.;N
I don’t like the material combination.;N
It was also done quickly.;N
I was working in a discomfort area.;N
However, I learnt to like it.;N
(Table 1: Picture 4) Working with ugly gave opportunities for viewing one’s life differently.;N
During and after the process, students viewed their lives differently, with new eyes.;N
By means of craft, it was possible to highlight alternative realities alongside the visible reality.;N
The imagination helped to look at spaces that were not yet there, but when imagined, in a way, they were already there.;N
According to futures studies such clarifications are important also for the experiental foresight processes [1].;N
Furthermore, conflicts, differences and disagreements drove the learning process further.;N
Viewing one’s life differently also produced ethical aspects: It was ugly to treat someone badly or to be treated badly (Table 1: Picture 6).;N
Also, there seemed to be a focus on final outcome, as if the design process was so intimate that it could not be publicly discussed or publicly outlined.;N
Behind the requirement for functionality and practicality could have been a habit of forming a fast opinion.;N
Sometimes students wanted to rush to the task and get it done quickly.;N
The first- and quicklymade solutions could have led the whole process in the wrong direction.;N
It was difficult to create a color chart, because at the very after that.;N

The goods that best satisfy their preferences are the ones of the highest quality [23].;N
Sometimes getting started was the problem, whereas other times, the problem occurred when a student got bogged down in a small detail with a well-advanced piece of work and stopped working.;N
Now and then, starting to do ‘whatever’ was the way to begin - or students procrastinated.;N
Procrastination was viewed as laziness, unreliability, irresponsibility and lack of initiative, but it was also a way of getting as much time as possible to think, dream or get inspired before beginning.;N
It was quite common to procrastinate for as long as the pressure was at its greatest, or if a deadline was approaching.;N
After all, it seemed that the students appreciated the speed of decisions and thinking.;N
The more satisfied you are with an idea, the faster the creative process may end.;N
Furthermore, judgements, negative or positive, were made in fractions of a second.;N
For example, the word ugly was used to describe a cute and childish experiment, when a student couldn’t quickly find an alternative expression.;N
Behind this interpretation could be the first impression, which is an intuitive understanding of the phenomenon.;N
It is an important tool for interaction that people rely on every day.;N
Although the first impression is a very short moment, its consequences can last a long time into the future.;N
The first impression is nearly always impossible to undo.;N
The following comment shows that the history of the assessment was in a situation experienced a long time ago, but the memories set the tone for later situations.;N

Eventually the experiment may have been rejected, because it did not provide any ideas for further development (Picture 1).;N
Students had high expectations of the quality, but not adequate knowledge and skill, or any suitable procedure to implement the idea.;N
Thus, they implemented ideas randomly (Picture 2).;N
Picture 3 reflects a perspective in which the work was evaluated as ugly, because the goal did not succeed in making an exact replication of the imagined idea.;N
At this stage, students focused more on the preferable futures, because they had challenges to articulate explicitly.;N
Students emphasized visible features such as technical solutions, material properties or appearance because as novices, they had inadequate basic knowledge, poor working practices or poor use of them.;N
Furthermore, these may have been the reasons for the limitations in creative thinking as well as the difficulty in seeing future opportunities when developing their experiments.;N
In addition, there were other barriers that may have prevented students from seeing creative opportunities.;N
Applying Mika Mannermaa’s ideas of making observations there could have been paradigm blindness, trend thinking and underestimation, for example.;N
Staying in one’s own paradigm limits thinking and prevents a person from seeing outside.;N
According to trend thinking, changes follow certain patterns and the same pattern will continue into the future.;N
Underestimation means that when something is seen for the first time, it could be viewed as a freak.;N
Sometimes freak ideas can become important over time.;N
[24] The pictures 4–6 are examples of experiments in which considerable attention was paid to the functionality of the outcome and the identifiable purpose.;N
Experiments were considered to be ugly because they were not functional and practical or one could not imagine any clear purpose or further use for them.;N
In some cases, the word ugly was used when there was no more representational word in mind.;N

Thus, I felt failure and frustration, which annoys me a lot, but I understand that this taught me to bear failure and to work in uncertainty.;N
The experimenting raised moral and ethical questions for consideration.;N
It was important to discuss what the moral issue was all about and who could or could not decide on moral matters.;N

Much attention was also given to the talk of wasting time and money, doing the right things, in the right order, at the right time, sufficiently well and quickly enough.;N
Themes in the discussion described contrary qualities, e.g.;N

While many other tools fail in highly uncertain environments due to their oversimplifying both problem description and possible solutions [100, 107], the scenario technique is a tool that has been developed for precisely such contexts [57, 81, 139].;N
In the following, the paper focuses on the use of the scenario technique as a specific strategy tool used in a sub-process of the overarching strategy process (Fig.;N

In this effort, t Tiberius European Journal of Futures Research (2019) 7:7 abilities of actors being neither a property of the environment nor of the actor but of the relationship between them [30].;N
The concept has been applied in many other fields, also in the areas of the paper’s scope such as organizational science [49, 92, 161] and strategic management [41, 77] and it specifically relates to futureoriented action [157].;N
While the usual focus is on individual behavior, social affordances are also discussed, especially in organizational contexts [49].;N
Three types of affordances can be distinguished.;N
First, intended effecter affordances correspond with the scenario technique’s original purpose, i.e., exploring multiple futures.;N
Second, hidden effecter affordances offer positive sideeffects that are not at the core of the scenario technique, but generate other organizational benefits.;N
The label of being “hidden” stems from the fact that such affordances are not obvious by the design of the tool [58].;N
The attribute “effecter” refers to achieving desired organizational outcomes [85].;N
Third, hidden handling affordances enable organizational members to gain personal benefits that can be either indifferent or conflicting for the organization.;N
In this context, the attribute “handling” addresses the affordances a tool offers to the actor, i.e., the user of the tool, as an individual as opposed to the organization this actor belongs to [85].;N
From a solely rational view, strategy tools are oriented toward organizational purposes only.;N
However, actors can use strategy tools also to pursue their personal goals [77].;N
However, tools do not come with offered possibilities alone, but can also imply constraints.;N
This is also the case for the scenario technique which has several fundamental restrictions inherent in its methodology.;N
Figure 2 shows the interrelationships between the different affordance types and constraints and their outcomes.;N

In th Tiberius European Journal of Futures Research (2019) 7:7 the environment is dynamic.;N
This paper focuses on the narrower sense of the scenario technique.;N
Following future research’s predominant paradigm of the futility of predictions and the need for the consideration of multiple feasible futures, organizations explore multiple future scenarios derived from diverse foresight methods [117] and often based on expert opinions [119].;N
In dealing with multiple futures, the scenario technique paradigmatically differs from predictive or forecasting methodologies such as Delphi studies [155] or prediction markets [156] whose outcome could be seen as the single, most probably scenario neglecting other potential future developments.;N
The scenario technique can also be used in conjunction with other techniques such as environmental scanning [128], identifying weak signals [4, 69], or roadmapping [162].;N
Just like the strategy process, also the scenario process is a sequenced process (Fig.;N
1).;N
After the scenario development process in the narrow sense is completed, the determined scenarios feed into the further scenario use phase [134], i.e., the organization’s strategy process, namely strategy development and, later, execution [110].;N
Apart from employing scenario techniques, organizations can also consider externally given scenarios such as those offered by Atherton for small businesses [6].;N
Whereas most strategy tools have a selective effect by stressing what to focus on and what to neglect [77], the scenario technique does not narrow but instead expands the focus of attention.;N
The method commonly used in firms to cope with this multiplicity of possible future developments is to identify the relevant scenarios and to assign the specific probabilities of occurrence to existing scenarios.;N
This is in line with risk management [9], which is also very common in firms and, fundamentally, is based on probabilistic thinking.;N
However, this probabilistic approach corre- evidence to support the l the use of scenarios and f them, these benefits woul ger time horizons.;N

“Weak signals” [4, 6 they are barely perceptible reveal their discontinuitie While black swans or wild Tiberius European Journal of Futures Research (2019) 7:7 its likelihood is a prediction of form.;N
Therefore, the problematic prediction of the future is pseudo-simplified by the problematic prediction of its likelihood.;N
 Biased cognition Another constraint of the scenario technique is the fact that (future) situations are subject to interpretation [84].;N
Individuals participating in scenario workshops have diverse interpretations [54] and are exposed to multiple cognitive biases [66, 107].;N
While the scenario technique reduces the framing bias in decision making [105], overconfidence, and tunnel vision [139], scenario planners can suffer from other biases such as selective attention as they unintentionally focus on specific scenarios and neglect others.;N
Such information processing filters in the process of environmental analysis can especially be formed by personal experiences, values, and personalities [63].;N
These biases do not only occur for the assessment of current but also for future situations as it is negligible whether the mental imagery refers to the present, the past, counterfactual pasts—or just imaginative futures [1, 21, 91, 138, 150].;N
Humans have the capability for mental time travel [148] based on their episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness, i.e., the ability to mentally place oneself in real or imagined situations [55].;N
Consequently, top managers will construct and focus on future scenarios that align with their personal experiences, values, and personality traits.;N
These effects are also observed when top managers delegate the scenario development process to foresight professionals because, according to the wishful-thinking premise, they tend to forecast what the employer wishes to hear [5].;N
First, personal experiences as parts of an individual’s episodic memory form future expectations [138] and preventable ones.;N

For example, many fu solely cognitive concept a Tiberius European Journal of Futures Research (2019) 7:7 considered.;N
If the future is expected to be more or less predetermined, vast deviations from current trends are seen as less probable and, therefore, less taken into consideration.;N
Scenario planners with a rather voluntarist worldview would have to assess the impact of different influencer groups on possible future developments.;N
In contrast, scenario planners who believe in pure chance as the main driver of future development would not consider human influences.;N
Relatedly, the degree of foreseeableness imbued in the process leads to decisions regarding the number and scope of scenarios.;N
Whereas openness addresses the ontology of the future, foreseeableness addresses the corresponding epistemology.;N
If the future is seen to be predictable, a main scenario with a high probability attracts most attention or other scenario will not be considered at all, hence, making the use of the scenario technique obsolete.;N
In contrast, if the future is seen as forecastable, multiple scenarios with distinct probabilities can be considered.;N
In a situation of “true ambiguity” [37], a broad scope of scenarios with no distinct probabilities have to be considered.;N
Hidden effecter affordances Hidden effecter affordances address additional benefits that can be gained from the use of scenarios that go beyond its original purpose.;N
They can be grouped into strategy- and organization-related affordances.;N
Strategy-related effecter affordances Positive side-effects of the scenario technique along the whole strategy process can be found in the literature.;N
First, the scenario technique can foster strategic analytical thinking [19].;N
It can contribute to more focused attention being placed on environmental dynamics [124].;N

This thought-experiment-like learning fosters strategic thinking ability [126].;N
Organization-related effecter affordances Apart from the hidden strategy-related affordances, the scenario technique also results in several positive sideeffects at the organizational level, especially regarding organizational behavior.;N
As scenario development is usually a practice that involves the participation of several organizational members, communication [89], and especially strategic conversation between them is facilitated [160], and its quality rises [35].;N
With scenarios being complex future configurations involving much specific information and specialist expertise from different functions and departments, this strategic conversation is not limited to a single management level but rather forges a cross-level and cross-functional communication process throughout the organization [73, 75, 99, 102, 115].;N
As people connect and exchange views across functions and departments [19], group cohesion [89], and motivations rise [26, 160].;N
Even without consensus, organizations benefit from these social interactions [171].;N
However, more often than not, a common perspective can be developed [160].;N
 practitioners were top or ternal employees, or exte 104].;N
Additionally, departm fore, functional focus play For strategic foresight, the organization’s disposa a prominent one, albeit n As the affordances offered skills an actor has [127] technique can have a sele agers who are experience cludes those who are not.;N

Especially middle experts with pieces of th needed to discover proba highly relevant for the s Nevertheless, their special ically make them participa Hidden handling affordances Hidden handling affordances allow an organizational member to gain personal benefits.;N
Regarding organizational goals, they can be either indifferent or conflicting.;N
Therefore, the usefulness of the scenario technique as a strategy tool cannot only be measured in terms of organizational performance but also the degree to which actors may achieve their personal goals [77].;N
In that sense, not only the strategy process [11, 45, 83, 99, 108, 109, 116, 133] or strategic discourses [10, 65] in general are political processes, Execution of scenario devel How practices are perform Therefore, managers partic process have the power to d velopment- and, therefore, can control the way the to are and are not produced [ ertion of power, also their by demonstrating their c Tiberius European Journal of Futures Research (2019) 7:7 do not necessarily unfold by accident alone but can, in part, be deliberately influenced or manipulated.;N
Communicating scenarios in the strategy development process As scenario development provides the informational foundation for the subsequent strategy formation, controlling this process constitutes a significant power base.;N
Strategizing is not only an interpretative process of sensemaking, i.e., trying to understand the given and possible future situations and options for today’s strategic action [83, 84, 90, 167] but also a process of sensegiving, i.e., communicating this subjective interpretation to others [43, 62, 112].;N
Especially when strategists did not participate in the scenario development process on their own, they have to familiarize themselves with the predetermined scenarios before they can feed them into the further strategy process [110].;N
This “handing over” of scenarios, as the output of the scenario development process and the input for the subsequent strategy development process, can offer opportunities for political interventions.;N
In particular, scenario developers can emphasize or even develop a specific scenario that best supports their goals and omits the communication of scenarios contradicting their personal agendas.;N
When, as usual, multiple scenarios are created, the preferred one can be presented in a favorable or convincing way.;N
In presenting scenarios, the specific use of language plays an important role, as language, in general, has a strong impact on strategizing to reach desired outcomes [12, 133, 137].;N
For example, extreme scenarios suggest selfconfidence in forecasting which has a convincing effect on others [5].;N
Similarly, precise forecasts, even when precision is not based on accurate calculations, imply expertise [97] and, therefore, have a persuasive effect.;N
Concrete numbers can especially give the impression of rationality [42].;N
 visualizing the future is a this sense, Baumgartner e “anticipated” emotions e the future and “anticipat the present in the context to understand the emotio future scenarios can be th motion and prevention, and avoiding pain [68].;N

In turn, scen future threat and, theref can substantially motivate happening and lead to sponses [29].;N

However, ins countermeasures to avoi come true, contrarily, res tuation could also occur that make the difference of control [71, 132], even Tiberius European Journal of Futures Research (2019) 7:7 scenarios that foster individual careers and power bases can obviously lead to poor strategic choices and flawed and misleading strategy.;N
Consequently, competitive disadvantages might arise, wherein even the survival of the firm is threatened.;N
As mentioned before, hidden handling affordances primarily address individual outcomes and affect organizational outcomes only indirectly.;N
In particular, by manipulating the scenario and strategy processes, the influencer tries to promote his or her personal goals, such as career goals.;N
However, this does not imply that the political actor necessarily provides “false” scenarios, especially as scenarios are not supposed to be predications which, later, can prove to be true or false.;N
Rather, the manipulator might select or stress scenarios that are or are not useful for the organization.;N
 Discussion Managers use the scenario technique not only in its intended sense, and this aberration does not always work out.;N
A view that concentrates on the solely rational side of the method alone—developing multiple scenarios to improve strategy development under conditions of high uncertainty—is necessarily limited.;N
By taking an affordancebased view on the scenario technique, it is possible to see the full range of possibilities and constraints of this method that also goes beyond its original idea.;N
Table 1 summarizes the affordances discussed in the paper, which does not claim to be exhaustive but rather represents the body of knowledge concluded from prior research.;N
The main contribution of this paper is to develop a framework that distinguishes between different possibilities and constraints offered by the scenario technique as a foresight and strategy method.;N
By distinguishing be- purposes that can be pu affordance-based view ca foresight in general.;N

Third, the presented view can be expanded to futurerelated thinking in general.;N
It can be expected that not only the use of foresight methods, but also other futurerelated phenomena might have unintended effects for the organization.;N
For example, inspiring visions, as mental images of appealing and realistic future situations, have a positive effect on motivation and individual and group performance [14, 86, 142, 147].;N
Similarly, mission statements, as statements about the intent to reach a future state, contribute to an increased organizational commitment and overall firm performance [13].;N
Which further positive and negative side-effects might such visions and mission statements have?;N
Future-related perceptions, values, and behaviors can also be implicit or explicit parts of the organizational culture.;N
For example, it can manifest the relevance of strategic foresight or the will to change the future.;N
Little research has been conducted on the relationships between strategic foresight and organizational culture.;N
Yet, for example, Korte and Chermack [88] explored how scenarios can be used to change organizational culture.;N
Further interesting research questions include: How are—and how can—explicitly future-oriented cultures be formed?;N
Which direct and indirect effects do future-oriented cultures have on performance?;N
An interesting starting point might be the work of Polak [120] who investigated the relationship between imagined societal futures and cultural development throughout several centuries of human history and posited that mental images about the future have, among several other factors, an influence on human behavior.;N
Finally, the classification and framework of affordances presented in this paper draws attention not only to the possibilities offered by the scenario technique in particular and Second, hidden effecte positive side-effects that cumstances relevant for For example, human resou nario technique as a lead or team leaders can use even if the development per se.;N

Consumer psychology Introduction Consumers have a nearly endless amount of opportunities nowadays.;N
Since the products are quite similar and there are no significant differences in quality or price, the choices are based on more than Btraditional^ variables.;N
Mediatisation of the world and the increasing power of social networks means that consumers’ choices are based more and more on identity play, gaining social currency and self-branding.;N
Furthermore, the choices are significantly influenced by the changes in the changes will affect decision table.;N

It is important to know how customers make decisions and what changes to anticipate.;N
Furthermore, it is important for policymakers who wish to be able to influence consumers’ consumption habits in order to make them healthier, greener, more ethical or more in favour of domestic products.;N
 How people do decisions We do decisions all the time.;N
Some decisions are automatic (or nearly so): making morning coffee, stopping at red lights, brushing our teeth in the morning, muttering BGood morning^ to co-workers, etc.;N
Some decisions are semi-automatic, they can be part of routines, but not totally automatic, for example choosing clothes in the morning, choosing lunch or choosing whether to buy an ice cream on the way home.;N
Then there are highly deliberated decisions like buying a house, choosing a vacation destination, etc.;N
Even though the decisions seem quite different, the decision-making process is similar.;N
However, people might not be aware of the subconscious steps in the decision-making process and the elements affecting the choice.;N
Decision-making theorists (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman [4], Bettman et al.;N
[5]) seem to basically agree on the steps in the choice process.;N
First there is a need for something, a motive.;N
After the need is established, there is a set of alternatives called an opportunity set.;N
Typically, opportunity sets are too large to be examined, so people limit their size to a consideration set.;N
After evaluating the benefits and costs of the alternatives in the consideration set, a choice needs to be done.;N
There are a number of different strategies, which can be used to do a choice.;N
Due to restricted cognitive abilities and desire to lower decision-making costs, some heuristics are typically used in decision-making.;N
In addition to heuristics, people may attempt to consider all possible options and features (make a so-called heuristics need to be used some can be quite automa sciously noticing it [11].;N
T have quite different views o making.;N
Simon [12] argue imperfect information mak lutions instead of seeking an & Johnson [13] argue that p strategies to the decision heuristics intently in order non-important.;N
Kahneman & very different view on heur ing (firstly) that people use and (secondly) that those systematic errors compare While Gigerenzer & T Kahneman & Tversky on a totally different view on Kahneman & Tversky p Gigerenzer & Todd concen ness of heuristics.;N
All the re sion strategies and heuristic sonal preference as well as heuristics are: & & Satisficing heuristic: O at a time, in the order th first acceptable alternat ply chooses the first s good enough.;N
If none p may be relaxed slightly Lexicographic heurist be chosen first and the ingly [17], for example thy, etc.;N
When using a le er will not be satisfied w Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 14 & Equal weight heuristic: Each attribute is given a value, all the alternatives’ values are added, and the highest score wins.;N
This method does not separate the attributes into important/unimportant or good/bad.;N
This kind of method is used in school grade evaluations or on Likert scale questionnaires.;N
The one with the best average score will be chosen [17].;N
 The choice of decision strategy is of utmost importance since it dictates what will be chosen.;N
For example, if I were to choose a travel charger for my phone, I might opt for colour (intuitive) or price (lexicographic), or I might consider price, battery capacity, colour, brand, etc., giving each feature a plus or minus (frequency of good and bad features heuristic).;N
With the same preferences, same options and same alternatives, the choices differ based on the choice of decision strategy.;N
 What affects the choice of decision strategy Shugan [20] compared different decision-making strategies on the basis of cost and benefit to the decision-maker.;N
The costs in Shugan’s model were effort required and number of mistakes made.;N
He found out that a reduction in thinking costs often leads to a reduction in benefits due to a growing number of mistakes.;N
Later, Payne et al.;N
[21] and Bettman et al.;N
[5] compared decisionmaking strategies on accuracy vs.;N
effort framework.;N
The basic idea is that each decision strategy can be characterised by its accuracy (the low level of mistakes) and the effort it requires.;N
Decision makers select strategies based on a compromise between the desire to make an accurate decision and the desire to minimise cognitive effort.;N
A number of studies have validated the effort and accuracy model of strategy selection [22, 23].;N

Bettm sion task is more compl 14 Page 4 of 12 The psychological drivers of consumer behaviour There is much more to consumption than just satisfying physical needs.;N
Everything we consume can be used as social currency, an identity claim, a tool for self-branding, a signal for values or a tool for regulating mood.;N
We form emotional connections to different products.;N
There are products we like and dislike (or even love and hate).;N
These types of relationships are explained by brands.;N
All products have a brand.;N
That is, all products, product groups, companies, institutions, politicians and even ordinary people have a brand.;N
Brand is the image the others have about the product, company or person.;N
We connect emotionally with brands because they have symbolic features and personalities [36, 37] and because they add many unique features to products, which make them extremely interesting.;N
Due to symbolic features, brands can be used for many purposes.;N
According to Belk [36], Fournier [37] and Escalas & Bettman [38], consumers use possessions and brands in identity building.;N
We choose what we consume in order to define ourselves [38] and because certain products are connected or enable certain social roles [39].;N
Some owned items function as identity claims.;N
Those items are symbols for belonging to certain groups, one’s identity, achievements or future goals.;N
According to Gosling [40], identity claims can be meant for ourselves or for others.;N
The identity claims meant for ourselves remind us about what kinds of people we are or want to be.;N
The identity claims meant for others are situated in visible places and signal to others how we want them to see us.;N
Brands and consumption can easily be used as identity claims due to their ability to transfer brand qualities into user qualities.;N
Therefore, one can easily attach certain desirable qualities for oneself by simply buying them [39].;N
Walker [41] says that a brand attaches an idea to the product.;N
When this is done well, people want to consume the idea by con- symbol, consuming certain tool) with other users.;N

The nature of the symbolic power of consumption matters also.;N
When consumers can use products in self-branding or as a signal of their values, they deliberate their decisions carefully, that is, they use rational decisionmaking (self branding 0.23** and signalling 0.12**).;N

There are already interesting signs of how valuable one’s social network can be.;N
It is no longer just getting a better job, but getting loans from the bank or getting the job at all.;N
Facebook has a patent for software that scans people’s trustworthiness (e.g., ability to pay back their loans) by scanning the social network they have [71, 72].;N
The algorithm is based on social media presence and the trustworthiness of people one is connected to.;N
In 2016, UK insurance firm Admiral intended to launch an application offering a discount on car insurance based on an analysis of customers’ Facebook posts, but this idea was turned down by Facebook [73].;N
These examples show how social networks are more important than ever and that people need tools to make themselves appear in a better light.;N
With power to share, contribute, produce and participate in a mediatised world, and being a member in the socially structured world where one needs to have social currency, signal values and tools for self-branding, it seems that the symbolics of consumption will become more important.;N
Consumers’ choices will be based more and more on reasoning about how this product will help them to see themselves in a better light, or provide a better picture of themselves to others.;N

 How will the change decision-making?;N
 The previous chapter pond making context.;N
In short, it Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 14 settle with good enough.;N
Some products have more symbolic power than others.;N
For example, buying toothpaste or sneakers bears totally different social currency potential.;N
It can be concluded that products will be more divided into those with symbolism potential and those without.;N
When consumers seek convenience, they also want effortless decision-making, which implies using some heuristics, for example elimination by aspects (0.10**).;N
Another way to look at the future of decision-making is to look at how young people (14–25 years) make decisions compared to older people.;N
Decision-making style is not a feature that develops by age, but is a construct of environment and personality.;N
The same data revealed that younger people have more motives (age correlates with number of motives by 0.13**), they experience more time pressure (0.17**), they find it more difficult to decide (0.22**), they have less energy for their decision-making (0.16**) and they are less able to concentrate when making decisions (0.13**).;N
Being impatient and suffering from time shortage, they also want to decide as quickly as possible (0.23**) and as effortlessly as possible (0.15**).;N
These needs lead to using more satisficing (0.14**), more lexicographic (0.12**), less careful deliberation (−0.21**) and less counting of plusses and minuses (0.20**).;N
In summary, this would imply that consumers will use more heuristics, satisficing and habitual decision-making in the future except when self-branding, or when careful deliberation is in order.;N
Due to a complicated world and more specific social needs, it is likely that the interplay between easy decisionmaking and accurate decision-making will be more important.;N
Some decisions demand more deliberating and some can be settled with good enough.;N
One interesting consequence of the more complicated world and consumers wanting to minimise effort while deciding is that the appeal for outsourcing the decision-making will grow.;N
Shopping suggestions applications (like Amazon or Netflix recommendations) will become more that consumer decision-ma identity play and social cur that the choices will be dep ed potential the product ha struggle between wanting t fortless decisions.;N

For example, it has been found that taxi drivers’ brains have developed in the area of navigation ability [84] and musicians’ brains develop differently [85].;N
Very recently it has been noticed that playing games, for example Super Mario, changes the players’ brains as well [86].;N
It has been suggested that gaming or gamers (due to the differences in their brains) could be used to solve problems of the modern world.;N
For example, Camille [87] argued that gamers learn to co-operate, face different people and cultures, anticipate and adapt.;N
The Finnish army believes in gamers, too, since according to Huhtanen’s [88] article, they plan on recruiting gamers as a separate group to offer a good challenge in war simulations.;N
Multitasking, time shortage, social pressures and mediatisation will most likely bring along interesting changes in brains and consumer decision-making in the future.;N

 Appendix: Description of data The data used in this study was originally collected for Willman-Iivarinen’s (2018) dissertation about consumers’ media choices.;N
There were questions related to media usage and preferences in general, but the main part of the questionnaire was dedicated to the last media usage event.;N
The respondents were asked to ponder which media products they considered, media usage motives, situations, habits and how they reach their decision.;N

This article is an open access publication Abstract Weak signals and wild cards are used to scan the environment and make systems more sensitive to emerging changes.;N
In this paper, the applicability of weak signals and wild cards is experimented in a case of a highly reliable and conservative sector, water and sanitation services.;N
The aim is to explore an approach suitable for water utilities.;N
The paper discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches to weak signals and wild cards, and reflects these in relation to the chosen approach.;N
It is argued that the process of weak signals and wild cards can serve as a communication and reflection exercise for an organisation like a water utility.;N
Furthermore, incorporating weak signals and wild cards can be an essential part in futures thinking, challenge prevailing mental models, and make systems more open to sense and learn from their environment.;N
It is recommended for water utilities to apply a loose approach on weak signals and wild cards and embed it as a part of their organisational culture.;N
However, it should be remembered that the approach should Introduction A variety of futures research stantly being developed to systems more Bsensitive to e ble so that they have better ti the opportunities of an emer wild cards and especially w changes in the future that cou existence have been eagerly In this paper we conduc methodology of weak sign water supply and sanitation cards have typically been a decision-making or nation vices provide in many way For example, water utilitie operational area, and thus i 4 Page 2 of 12 capabilities [11].;N
Thus, in the next section we will describe the context of water services and elaborate on our objective.;N
 Water services as a context In industrialised nations, water services are typically considered highly reliable.;N
People rely on the continuity of these services, they expect to get safe water simply by turning on the tap, and expect wastewater to disappear without harming the environment or human health when flushing the toilet.;N
However, if something goes wrong, it could compromise significantly the well-being of many.;N
One example is the water crisis in the Finnish town of Nokia in the year 2007: some 6000 people were taken ill because treated wastewater was accidentally released into the drinking water distribution system.;N
Another example is the water crisis of City of Flint, Michigan, where residents were exposed to high levels of lead in the drinking water [12].;N
Thus, if a wild card materialises in water services, the question is not just about business opportunities or threats, but about human lives and functioning societies.;N
Water services support either directly or indirectly all socio-economic activities, during the Nokia water crisis, for example, schools and day care centres had to be closed down and many businesses struggled.;N
On the whole, the Nokia water crisis had a long-lasting socio-economic effect for local businesses.;N
The water services system can be characterised as a relatively static system.;N
In industrialised countries these systems have mostly been built between the Second World War and the 1980s.;N
During this era, development was expected to be mostly linear.;N
For example, many of the pipelines were scaled for stable growth of consumption, which proved unrealistic after the oil crisis in the 1970s and the introduction of new water saving household appliances.;N
Unfortunately, infrastructure systems are rather inflexible and there has not been significant changes in the systems after the adaptation of centralised drink- engineers are used to focus able with uncertainty and characteristics are not limi generalised to all of us.;N
Ac not cope well with uncerta understanding the past it is future [15].;N
In addition, Ta focus too narrowly on one’ estimate one’s own knowle timate the role of chance an and overestimate their own sum up, it is not inherent to sector - especially those organisational culture and systems - to be adaptive an The world has changed ment of water services is ge etal changes, such as the d ciety, have affected the pra Nowadays, almost everyon mation and communication standards for the transparen From the point of view of either as an opportunity o more vulnerable if their ac tions but, on the other hand, observe and reflect the ope It is debatable whether th its static nature.;N
There are s services sector compromisin tion to the identified challeng but major changes looming a ly impact the field.;N
It has bee increasing in the infrastructu the nature of water services, loops.;N
Meadows argues that Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 4 perspective, water services are entangled with and bound within wider sociotechnical, political, cultural and economic complexes [22, 23].;N
We, in the field of water services, need to be more sensitive to what is happening elsewhere in society and take this into consideration in strategic planning.;N
As Hiltunen argues weak signals can help us to break prevailing mental models, encourage us to think differently, and help us to be more innovative about the futures [1].;N
Because of our aspiration to challenge prevailing mental models and the conservative character of water services sector, and our interest in systems view, our approach is more inclined to that of critical futures studies than on the strong empiricist and technical orientation of foresight activities [9, 24, 25], and this will also guide our methodological choices that are discussed in the next section.;N
 Methodological framework This section first of all covers a short overview of theory on weak signals and wild cards, and methodology related to them.;N
At the end, the material choice of this study is introduced.;N
Weak signals Igor Ansoff, who can be considered the pioneer of weak signals analysis, defines weak signals as imprecise early warnings about impeding impactful events [26].;N
Weak signals are too incomplete to permit an accurate estimation of their impact, and/or to determine a complete response [4, 27].;N
There are, however, many views on weak signals some of which are contradictory [3, 28].;N
For example, some use the terms ‘emerging issues’, ‘seeds of change’, ‘wild cards’ and ‘early warning signals’ interchangeably with weak signals, whereas others make a clear distinction between these terms [1].;N
According to Moijanen, weak signals are generally defined way^ [11].;N
Following the weak signals depends on Thus, same signal can in and in another as strong.;N
Wild cards Wild cards have been part of ing since the 1960s.;N
Howev proach to study wild cards book Out of the Blue: How was published.;N
[29].;N
Wild c surprising events with huge or anomalous consequences er, that wild cards can also b we want to be able to exploi rapidly that normal, planned spond, making the organisat Petersen and Steinmüller ar connected world of today, i study wild cards so that we c or in some cases even d Furthermore, wild cards can uncertainty [32].;N
Some use wild cards as a however, defines wild cards as weak signals are signs of wild cards [1].;N
Whether or n synonyms, depends on how accepts that weak signals can then wild cards and weak s However, if one maintains themselves but indications o are not synonyms.;N
Instead, i precede wild cards.;N
Thus, w means to anticipate wild car 4 Page 4 of 12 (the unknown unknowns).;N
The last type of wild cards, the unknown unknowns can only be judged by hindsight [29].;N
Mendonça et al.;N
[30] argue that it is sometimes possible to anticipate wild cards in advance as weak signals of it are available.;N
The question is if someone notices these signals and is able to make Bcorrect^ interpretations.;N
In the case of the Nokia water crisis the weak signals were observations made by consumers reporting on changes in the appearance of the drinking water.;N
Consumers complained about these to the water utility, but these complaints, or weak signals, were not taken seriously.;N
The Nokia water utility assumed that foaming of the tap water and its weird smell and taste were due to pressure changes in the water distribution network.;N
It was only after two days when people reported stomach problems that the issue was taken seriously.2 If the weak signals had been taken seriously and reacted earlier on, it probably would have been possible to limit the extent of the water epidemic.;N
Methodology In general, the methodology of weak signals and wild cards is part of the process of horizon or environmental scanning [10, 27, 34], and as such, it situates in the interpretative domain [9].;N
It is qualitative in nature and relies on subjective and creative analysis [10].;N
Popper maintains that the methodology is undeveloped, and there are calls for more rigorous processes [35].;N
Some methods to analyse weak signals have been developed.;N
For example, Ansoff has created a Weak Signal Issue Management System (Weak Signal SIM).;N
Hiltunen argues that the practical use of Ansoff’s approach appears to be very mechanistic as there is no space for creativity and intuition [1].;N
According to Schultz, a basic approach to scan environment for weak signals consists of the following phases [36]: 1) choosing from five to nine information sources, that should preferably be from different sectors and should cover both, specialist and fringe sources, 2) creating a scanning database, specific to case in question.;N
brainstorming, science ficti The identified wild cards narrowed down so that only be considered in the followi of monitoring weak signals o options for action (to preven cards) are discussed.;N
Usually, identification a wild cards is conducted by with expertise and creativ search engines can be us amount of data.;N
One key qu of sources to search for si survey study asking futuris sources of weak signals.;N
A connections are emphasise are researchers, futurists, c journals, and reports of res As is obvious from the variety of ways to underst on weak signals and wild approach we applied in our Approach in this study The method we used in this of the approaches described are often used as a part of case, however, was somew to create scenarios or strateg whole water service sector small scale experiment on w if they could be applied in point was that the process s in daily practices and on ro Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 4 to water sector directly as our source material.;N
In addition, we used some other materials, like blog texts.;N
These were used in the first phase when we were trying to scan for interesting issues and problems external to the water sector.;N
Hiltunen also recommends the use of so called peripheral sources (such as arts, science fiction, alternative press, blogs) [39].;N
We decided to cover a time span of one year for the newspapers and magazines (March 2010 – March 2011).;N
The newspapers chosen were Aamulehti and Lapin Kansa.;N
We did not read all the issues published during the particular year, but made a selection and focused on papers of 11th and 27th day of each month.;N
Aamulehti is the newspaper in the Tampere area and Lapin Kansa is published in northern Finland.;N
Magazines chosen were Image and Kuluttaja.;N
Image magazine covers a wide range of phenomena from popular culture to politics, and it can be characterized as a trendsetter.;N
We chose Image as we thought it might offer some fresh perspectives.;N
Kuluttaja magazine is published by the Finnish Consumer Agency and it focuses on reviews of products and services.;N
Kuluttaja was chosen to give perspectives of changes in consumer culture and preferences of people.;N
After the choice of sources, we read through the material and made notes of everything novel and unexpected that sparked our imagination.;N
After the scanning phase, we discussed our findings and interpretations, and clustered them into themes.;N
 Findings As described, we started the empirical part of this study by discussing things that feel funny about water services and things that are happening, but we cannot really pin them down.;N
Second, we read the newspapers and magazines.;N
The results are shortly described in this section.;N

People expect more information about chemical consistency and additives of different products in an understandable way.;N
Some businesses had already responded to these demands.;N
An example of this is a full-page advertisement by a dairy producer on new margarine that is Btotally without additives^.;N
The third issue that we found interesting was related to political decision-making.;N
There were some articles about how power has been shifted away from democratically chosen political decision-makers to professional civil servants.;N
For example, in Image 8/2010 the victory of an Icelandic political party that was set-up just as a joke was explained by voters’ frustration towards the toothless political decision-making in the past.;N
In general, there were calls for politicians to resume power and 8/2010 Icelandic populism (Discussion o Reykjavik’s elecon resu where comedian wa elected as th mayor, analys of people’s frustraon with polics of the service is.;N

In the assessed against theories on Discussion Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 4 later on that the evidence was misleading) and false negatives (being right but on false grounds) even in hindsight [5].;N
According to Rossel, we should not only focus on the signals themselves but the process [11].;N
We should ask how and why we chose signals and interpreted them in a certain way.;N
Thus, we will discuss our findings against theories on weak signals and wild cards.;N
First of all, the reliability of findings depends on the resources or materials used.;N
According to Hiltunen [1] weak signals can be divided into primary and secondary exosignals.;N
Primary signals are directly connected to an emerging issue and are, for example, visual observations of it.;N
When primary signals are interpreted and presented e.g.;N
in newspapers, they turn into secondary signals.;N
Hiltunen [1] warns that there is a risk with secondary signals being distorted or even fictitious.;N
Probably one of the biggest weaknesses in this study was the sources we chose.;N
We used mainly newspapers and magazines, and thus it can be said that we relied only on secondary signals.;N
A further weakness with the materials used in systematic scanning was that none of them were really peripheral or alternative as recommended [39], but they were mainstream.;N
In the background, identifying the emergent issues, we did use blog writings but these were not used in the systemic scanning.;N
The original idea was to include also peripheral sources for scanning, but this was given up due to lack of time.;N
Then again, as the futurists in Hiltunen’s study emphasised, it is not the sources of weak signals that are important, but rather the processing of them [39].;N
Thus, the actual process will be discussed next.;N
As mentioned, we started by discussing issues that had puzzled us.;N
According to van der Heijden, people have tacit knowledge consisting of isolated observations and experience that they have not yet been able to integrate with their codified knowledge and this is also why they do not understand meaning of these very clearly [42].;N
Furthermore, he describes weak signals as unconnected insights and knowledge.;N
It could be said that our first discus- secondary exosignals.;N
How issue in mind, is also part in the literature [29, 37].;N
Interpretation, in our cas the relevance of signals in warns of emphasising the r filtering especially of signa have a big impact in the argued that weak signals we intuit that they have so 42].;N
It is a tempting idea th without preconceptions.;N
Ho sible.;N
Instead, we agree w should make Bour assumpti of the weak signal identific account the different usage ing to our diverse roles an first part of the results, desc an attempt to make our ass Another issue that could sults by helping to avoid t educational background, po would have been to includ more diverse backgrounds sumptions and tacit know results would probably Hiltunen’s study emphasise sion in finding weak signal the process is actually stru [4].;N
In addition, it would b the design of the frame of i One could criticise our a lacked an explicit frame Moijanen argues that scann tematic search as one must from the background no 4 Page 10 of 12 are being managed.;N
Actually, Mendonça et al.;N
maintain that thinking about weak signals can help to acknowledge the limits of foresight abilities [4].;N
Our interpretations and analysis were mostly based on analogies, i.e.;N
scanning for signals from other sectors and analysing what these could mean in the water services sector.;N
This kind of approach is criticised by van der Heijden [42].;N
He argues that the validity of such analogies cannot be assessed and thus, it must be concluded that the resulting subjective probabilities are untestable, arbitrary and meaningless.;N
However, Ruuttas-Küttim encourages combining different contexts to weak signals in order to see their real potential [1].;N
Furthermore, it is questionable whether our findings really count as weak signals or wild cards.;N
For example, the issue with the possible chemical contamination of tap water from the plastic pipes is more likely a gradual change than a wild card, as it is not a rapid development and water works could monitor this and change their behaviour in case some concerning results would appear [12].;N
Most of the other issues we discussed are also more gradual than rapid in nature.;N
Thus, it could be said that we were not able to recognise actual wild cards.;N
However, it needs to be remembered that it is also important to monitor weak signals for gradual change.;N
As Hiltunen points out, people tend to ignore weak signals indicating gradual change [31].;N
Moreover, one could say that our weak signals are not signals but more like trends.;N
This is due to the fact that they are presented in combination with the interpretations and they have been clustered together.;N
Hiltunen actually reminds us that the single weak signals do not tell us much about futures, but a number of weak signals might tell us something about emerging trends in the future.;N
She argues, thus, that weak signals should be clustered to trends [1].;N
It is debatable, whether the signals we found could be considered as weak.;N
This again is related to our choice of materials and methodology.;N
According to Hiltunen, a key characteristic debatable whether we can stated in the beginning of t cards can only be full Furthermore, are the signa they can be easily verified test of weak signals that is b [1].;N
According to Hiltunen, or it is not really talked ab weak signal.;N
We presented drinking water from the tap a long silence which was fo pidity of the whole idea.;N
It upset by the sheer idea of t reinforced our idea that it w sector to thinking in new mental models to better pr of these events in the futur According to Holopainen highly subjective [3].;N
Once objectivity and subjectivity lems of assessing signals b cards are partly evidence-bas of imagination, thinking and that the Brightness^ or Bcor wild cards is secondary and process itself.;N
Studying theo scanning the sources for them us to attune our senses to si and to acknowledge the lim Following Mendonça et al., the potential for social and o capability to deal with unce expected [see also 33].;N
T Bpreparing for future unk business^ [4].;N
Thus, horizo on routine basis to uncove Eur J Futures Res (2017) 5: 4 findings would be Bcorrect^ as weak signals and wild cards can only be judged with hindsight.;N
However, we do not think that this exercise was useless but quite the contrary.;N
We have presented some of our findings to other people in the water services sector.;N
Reactions have ranged from ignorance to anger.;N
We argue that scanning for weak signals and wild cards can help one to step out of one’s comfort zone and think also about inconvenient issues [45].;N
Even if the weak signals and wild cards would not materialise in the future, it is useful to challenge oneself to think differently.;N
This small experiment, for example, has moulded our research interests and encouraged new ways of looking at challenges of water services.;N
Sustainability of water services is a key issue for the wellbeing of people.;N
The world becomes increasingly complex, unpredictable and uncertain, and this will eventually impact also the water services sector increasingly.;N
As the sector is static and conservative, it is not very agile to react to these changes.;N
This makes the need for strategic thinking and planning even more evident.;N
The idea of weak signals and wild cards can play an important part in this [48].;N
Water services, by their nature, strive for keeping balance, a lot of effort is put to ensure that nothing unwanted occurs.;N
In this regard, it is a sort of crisis management long before any crisis takes place.;N
Thus, as Edwards argues [49], vigilant organisations capable of social learning succeed well in avoiding crises and accidents, even if their operations are heavily based on technologies [50].;N
More theoretically speaking, exploring weak signals and wild cards can serve as a communication and reflection practice in which new information is processed, thereby producing and decreasing entropy in the social system.;N
Organisation’s ability to continuously produce and decrease entropy can ensure its autopoietic process by which an organisation can evolve over time [51].;N
We therefore see that weak signals and wild cards are useful methods for improving vigilance and learning in the organisations of the water services sector.;N
Thus, we recommend water utilities and other central ac- Acknowledgments Financi Foundation is gratefully acknow express our gratitude for the th ments and suggestions significa Open Access This article is dis Commons Attribution 4.;N

We consider c as a critical futures studies method, to be an appropriate method to deconstruct the p the future of the relationship between media and politics in Iran.;N
We utilize four differe determine different aspects of litany level, including the role of media in promoting en Iran’s enemies, real and fictitious.;N
Second, we specify different systemic causes for the media and politics, including the continuous attempts of Iran’s state regime to control media sphere.;N
Third, we review the two main discourses involved in the 1978–1979 Re discourse is focused on constructing alternative responses to the controversy between the contemporary history of Iran.;N
Fourth, in the entitled level of metaphor or myth, we “Educating the Populace” as the deepest myth behind the relationship between media next stage of this study, we construct the possible scenarios for the future of the relati politics in Iran based on the dominance of competitive root discourses.;N
Finally, we arg beyond the discursive layer to find the alternative futures of the relationship between Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 collective subconscious.;N
Nevertheless, informal politics influence decision-making behind closed doors, particularly upon the advent of alternative media.;N
While the official and mainstream media platforms are being controlled by the state regime, alternative interest groups use alternative media and communication platforms to raise their pluralistic demands, though these alternative platforms are usually under several major limitations, for example, they may be banned or filtered.;N
Politicians have always attempted to control and dominate media power using top-down tactics to varying extents.;N
Whether during the Pahlavi era or after the Iranian Revolution in 1978–1979, the history of media and communication in Iran indicates that all the state regimes and governments have aimed to control the media sphere by different means, like through censorship or licensing [1].;N
Media platforms are not officially governmental organizations, and they are not included in the state’s structure, thus, hierarchical orders in the political structure cannot be applied to media platforms.;N
Consequently, officials and politicians resort to employing different media platforms to advocate their political interests.;N
These interests may be advanced through official apparatus, like enforcing a law or legalizing censorship, or unofficial ones like threatening and bribing journalists or fulminating against those who do not support a certain political opinion or objective.;N
Overall, the most significant issue in the relationship between media and politics in Iran is the fact that media have always been controlled and dominated by the politics and political structures.;N
After the establishment of a modern centralized state regime in the country, all the political systems and governments in Iran have tended not to cooperate, negotiate, or participate but to control, bridle, and supervise the media.;N
 new media platforms pro tools and channels to ec mand for public participa and decision-making.;N
In technology has created a people, as well as critical i fluential role in the politi Although these alternativ have been significantly media, a relatively free me Iran, as the majority of trolled by the state regime political structures and in are absent in the political To sum up the curren and politics in Iran in one are dominated by the stat and propagating the state objectives.;N
At the same tim resist top-down politics to of plural social strata in Ir To understand the pseud media sphere, we need to which the alternative medi objectives, resist mainstrea institutionalize official gov between mainstream and few narrow aspects of the practice as well as politica and modality, particularly layered analysis (CLA) is o ical and methodological deeper social causes and Following a critical approa studies is retrieved from t Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 discourses in Iran’s media politics.;N
We argue that educating people, instead of informing them, is the most preventive myth in the deepest layer of the relationship between media and politics.;N
After constructing the possible futures scenarios based on the discourse layer, we also explain a vision of an alternative critical future which can be imagined transforming the situation from the status quo into a more desirable scenario.;N
This part is the most important contribution of this paper to the literature of media politics.;N
We claim that this alternative vision has a great credibility to open a spectrum of alternative futures for the relationship between media and politics.;N
 Why CLA?;N
Causal layered analysis (CLA) is known as a critical futures research method which deepens the understandings about the futures changes.;N
According to Inayatullah, CLA is based on the assumption that the way in which a problem is framed will have an impact on how a change in the issue will be pursued [3].;N
While the theoretical underpinning of CLA is based on post-structuralism, the approach is layered, that is, it is a method of analysis which is inclusive of accounting for various streams of causality operating in unison upon an issue [4].;N
As Inayatullah [3] explains, causal layered analysis (CLA) consists of four dimensions.;N
The first is the litany, or the day-to-day layer, the commonly accepted headlines about the way things are or should be.;N
Solutions to problems are, at this level, usually short term.;N
The second dimension is deeper, focused on the social, economic, and political causes of the issue.;N
The third dimension is the culture or worldview.;N
This is the big picture, the paradigm that informs what we think is real or not real, the cognitive lens we use to understand and participatory environment has been applied in variou method or in combinatio like scenarios, futures wh the most important prac presented in the book, “ (CLA) Reader.” Accordin traffic futures (1993), the housing persons with dis of United Nations (1996) ing CLA in research fr environment.;N

The bene scope and richness to sc taking into consideration practices and abilities of “hard” sciences to the fut discussion naturally from levels.;N
In this sense, we fin to analyze the relationship the present and the future explore the role of key a this relationship.;N
Moreover, CLA assists tween media and politic deepened manner and t Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 words, the critical approach aims to deconstruct the present power relations, understand the historical causes and discourses which resulted in the present situation, and evoke alternative possibilities for the future.;N
This study reflects upon the crucial usefulness of CLA in studying the relationship between media and politics in general by focusing on the analysis of this relationship in the case of Iran.;N
Exploring this relationship in Iran as a case study is not only crucial for anticipating the future challenges in Iran in a bigger picture but also a good theoretical and methodological approach to analyze the relationship between media and politics in other countries and other contexts.;N
Any political entity, whether it is a nation-state or a larger one like the European Union, must establish a particular articulation between media obligations and political objectives, and CLA can be an appropriate method for such an articulation.;N
In this sense, the application of CLA for critical analysis of the relationship between media and politics in Iran is significantly useful and important from a European perspective due to the fact that it not only provides an appropriate case study, the method of which academicians can pursue, but also might facilitate the deconstruction of the relationship between media and politics in other contexts like the European countries.;N
With a deconstructive perspective, knowledge is achievable and conceivable by the contradictory negations, instead of the affirmative harmony of descriptions.;N
Thus, our findings might indirectly provide an outlook for the media politics in Europe by demonstration of how distinct relationships between media and politics are established in Iran, currently or throughout history.;N
In this paper, we unfold the most vital story, which has been told by Iranian intellectuals and politicians the vital instrument to pro of speech on the one hand crystallization of public mediated channels on the explore the implications o tionship between media a layers, while we advocate politics as an alternative for Iran.;N

As Inayatullah say superficial and present trends [3].;N
They are usu routine documents and r legislation.;N
Regarding the and politics in Iran, at th news, documents, and l between politics and me this sense, we scan many larly all the relevant rein Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 Media ownership is the first key element of the relationship between media and politics in Iran.;N
Following a conventional categorization of media, all media platforms can be assigned one of three categories including press media, broadcast media, and digital media.;N
The majority of the mainstream media in all three categories are owned by the state regime in Iran.;N
State-owned media can be defined as media which are financially and editorially controlled and administered by different governing bodies and departments.1 Regarding this definition, radio and television broadcasting in Iran is completely owned and monopolized by the state regime, while digital media and press media are partly state-owned, while some kinds of privately owned and alternative media are coexisting with the state-owned ones as well.;N
Article 175 of Iran’s constitution [11], which guarantees the freedom of expression in radio and television broadcasting, of course in keeping with the Islamic criteria, explains that, “the appointment and dismissal of the head of the Radio and Television of the Islamic Republic of Iran rests with the Leader.” Moreover, Article 175 states that a council consisting of two representatives each of the President, the head of the judiciary branch, and the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Iranian Parliament shall supervise the functioning of IRIB [11].;N
The first article of the statute of IRIB [12] emphasizes the state regime’s ownership and administration and determines that radio and television broadcasting (IRIB) is administered based on the said law, the law stipulating the policies of the organization and this article of association under the joint supervision of the three branches of government.;N
According to the regulations related to the Internet infrastructure, the access service provider (ASP) for Internet connections is monopolized and owned by the media platforms are relati different private presses a fields.;N
However, there are media that are owned and gime.;N
These presses are some official documents a the characteristics of stat ways.;N
They have an annu ment budget, they use sta under the control of the editorially.;N
These press m the mainstream print m bigger circulations and th cial problems due to thei budgets.;N
Djankov and his colleagu media distort and manipul incumbent politicians, pr from making informed de mine both democracy and vate and independent me the public and enable political candidates, goo fear of abuse by unscru and promoters.;N
Moreove among private and com voters, consumers, and unbiased and accurate in Media control is the se ship between media and p Islamic Republic of Iran s imperial government in P and governments have alw press the media sphere in eral methods Iran’s state Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 propose the policy documents to be approved by Iran’s Parliament (note 1).;N
In addition, this board has the power to supervise the broadcasting activities to ensure they are in accordance with general policies, and to control the frames of radio and television productions and programs to be consistent with the state’s political policies (note 2, note 3).;N
The broadcasting supervision council is even authorized to intervene in minor management issues, such as appointment and dismissal of senior and mid-level managers of the broadcasting system in offices both domestic and abroad (note 15).;N
This can illustrate the dominance and authority of the state regime and its branches on the radio and television broadcasting system.;N
According to Iran’s press law [15], any publication, whether in print or in online news media, by actual and legal persons with Iranian capital, requires obtaining a license from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.;N
Therefore, every commercial and private press is, in a way, under the control of the state regime.;N
A press supervisory board is established to issue press licenses and investigate the required qualifications of the actual or legal person who seeks the license (article 11).;N
The press supervisory board consists of seven members from different state sectors, taken from the following: the Ministry of Justice, the Parliament, the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, Hoze-Elmie-Ghom (the main Shia religious school in Iran), press director (chosen from within), and universities’ professors (chosen by the minister of Science, Research, and Technology), the final member is the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance.;N
Obviously, all the decisions of the supervisory board are under the control and dominance of the state regime, since it has six members out of seven on the board.;N
In other words, the state regime is entitled to decide who is eligible to have a publication license and who is not.;N
 have any broadcasting lic ample of this alternative Internet users in Iran use cess to online websites an are filtered by Iran’s state users are using a consider ing platforms (i.e., Twitt Telegram) and online new though many of these di and filtered by the state multiple legal limitations.;N
The influence of the stat duction is the third eleme media and politics in Ira goal and mission of the s Iran is to recreate and pro discourses, which are desi state regime, particularly can be claimed that the st its own media and enfor platforms to promote an itional, and ideological valu According to Article 9 broadcasting statute [12] television broadcasting is The other indicated aims preparing the social envi and refinement, increasin accelerating the evolution worldwide.;N
The Article 11 phasizes the international explains that radio and t develop international rela the light of Islam and Is third article of the law for Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 versions of press and publications, and online news agencies and websites.;N
In this sense, all different kinds of news media platforms including traditional press and Internet-based online news media are restricted by the state regime to produce media content inside the dominant Islamic discourse.;N
The violation of these rules and norms is considered to be a violation of the law, and the violator media platform will be subject to a vast spectrum of punishments and penalties.;N
As mentioned before, there has always been a media counterflow that attempts to appear as an alternative platform and bypass the state regime’s restrictions.;N
Accordingly, alternative media platforms in Iran, meaning those independent media that can bypass the control and censorship, usually aim to produce some alternative media contents.;N
These alternative media try to provide their audiences with different modernist media content including secular, feminist, environmental, liberal, leftist, and ethnic-based ideas.;N
They empower the audiences to choose their desired content among a colorful spectrum of contents.;N
However, it can be said that these media platforms are generally concentrated on pro-Western and somewhat anti-traditionalist values and cultural characteristics.;N
 Systematic causes: semi-totalitarian regime and its dissidents The level of the social cause in CLA is the systematic level in which the social causation in terms of the links between the individuals and society are analyzed.;N
According to Inayatullah [18], the role of the state and other actors and interests is often explored at this level.;N
As he explains, the two key questions asked at this level are, “who is responsible for this?” and “what policies and structures gave rise to this?”.;N
Accordingly, we aim to extended to the telecomm frastructures.;N
For example nication infrastructures fo Iran are state-owned and c the “Telecommunications [19].;N
According to differen uals and organizations are sess any kind of broadcast in Iran.;N
Moreover, the act eign radio and television ch receivers are forbidden and As a semi-totalitarian r always aimed to dominate a propaganda machine th ideological discourses and ing Islamic and revolution crucial objectives of the s complished by dominatin As mentioned before, pr lamic values has been rep laws, legislation and inst the main ultimate purpos Iran’s state regime influe manding propagation of tries and preventing the values.;N

In this sense, the state regime has always utilized the dominated media platforms to not only promote the enmity with Western countries but also to implicitly mobilize the public mass against pro-Western social communities and elites.;N
However, the state regime is not the only actor in the relationship between media and politics in Iran.;N
In the current historical period, other actors have become influential and effective in determining this relationship by their roles and their original aims [23].;N
About 10 years after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, when the governmental economy and pro-socialist economic policies started to fail in realizing their promises and privatization of economy started to rise, the market became a crucial actor in the media sphere in Iran.;N
Commercial and private newspapers and publications started to emerge, and they were supposed to convey a counterflow of content production in the media sphere.;N
In 1997, when the reformist political parties succeeded to win the presidential election, a powerful public demand emerged for a colorful media sphere.;N
As many claim [24–26], the reformist government aimed to relatively decrease the control and pressure on the civil society to allow the private press and media to be more independent and to allow more the freedom of speech.;N
In this era, the civil society in Iran became an important actor in the relationship between media and politics.;N
The civil society was empowered to facilitate the publication of small and medium size newspapers and different kinds of publications.;N
At the same time, the reduction of state control over the media sphere caused the emergence of more independent media platforms striving to convey a voice for the voiceless.;N
Although many relatively independent newspapers emerged in this era, trying to stand in a critical position in contrast with different means of filterin other proxies have empow the digital media in the w anything they want on th television and radio sate ible and popular in Iran, consume these media pla the state-owned broadcas IRIB or conventional stat the official legislation wh satellite channels in Iran foreign-based channels v receivers at their homes a television channels [27].;N
It can be claimed that a ety, and technology have mining the relationship b Iran, the state regime ha important key actor.;N
The in Iran with more than 95 audiences is still owned by tered by the state regime print and online news private and relatively ind financially secured by the nancial aids.;N
Hence, they media sphere by having the state ownership of t Iran makes the state regi speed and traffic of the sense, when the state reg the ASP and is also capa tions and controlling the net, one could conclude t the Internet users to use Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 analysis (DA) meet various questions [28, 29], CLA mainly relies on critical discourse analysis (CDA), particularly the Foucauldian approach to CDA [10, 18].;N
“Struggle over meaning” is a crucial concept in this layer.;N
Discourses as meaning orders articulate themselves around a focal node, which organizes some other nodes in turn to construct a cohesive and prevalent body of knowledge.;N
However, there is no society in which just a single discourse can be identified practically.;N
Although struggle over meaning is the dominant one, others quarrel to find more hegemonic positions.;N
In addition, we should consider the fact that original discourses are usually limited and durable.;N
As Foucault [30] indicates, mega-discourses are just two or three during a long period of time.;N
Although there is a limited specific literature about the relationship between media and politics in early periods in which press media arrived in Iran as a new literary genre, and modernity converted into a political objective as a new body of knowledge, we can interpret some of the valuable inquiries [31, 32] demonstrating how the struggle for modernism crystallized the vital social and political transformations.;N
As a result, we can track back to find a blueprint in which one of the most original discursive struggles has been triggered and continued for almost two centuries in the modern history of Iran.2 According to Sharifi [31], for instance, there are two basic pre-modern signifiers that constitute the official state discourse from the Shah Abbas Safavi era (1587– 1629) until the 1906 Constitutional Revolution: Islam and security.;N
Encountering Western modernity after 1870, new thoughts and opinions suggested some alternative signifiers in order to create several new imagined political discourses: law, development, people/democracy, and class/equality.;N
After the mid-1850s, those who tradition” in which the m ists, strive to restore tradi cial and political transform of tradition” in which s camps make a widely de the dynamic elements o Hajarian believes that th lamic Revolution of Iran in deavor to reconciliatio modernity indicates imp some types of struggle at f The struggle between tr its culmination when the final victory in 1978–1979 rismatic cleric, Ayatollah political regime was estab Iran.;N

Those who wer radical modernists after.;N
occurred at the beginni Mehdi Bazargan, one of t figures, was forced to re interim government as th sure from traditionalists w political decision-making supported the US Embass radical Islamist groups, th the Imam’s Line.;N
According to Soltani [3 ists who were two wings Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 system but also the necessary financial and legislative apparatus to propagate the traditional values in the public sphere.;N
Dominated by pro-traditionalists, some executive organizations, which are not supposed to own a media platform, allocate a huge amount of resources to media practices.;N
To understand how the traditionalist worldview is embedded in the mainstream media, it is enough to say, for instance, that according to the Deputy of Press and Information Affairs, affiliated to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance,3 there are 28 licensed legal Persian news agencies, of which at least 15 directly or indirectly belong to clerics and military organizations promoting traditionalism even through sport news services (like supporting the “hijab” worn by female athletes), in addition to the IRIB news department, which is the most powerful news agency due to the fact that it legally monopolizes the right of TV and radio broadcasting.;N
Supported by different theocratic institutions, most of these organizations have their own platforms like newspapers, magazines, and periodicals.;N
Despite the discursive diversity among different clerical or militant organizations, what they prescribe for the vast range of socio-cultural and political issues is always extracted from different versions of traditionalist discourse, whether the supreme leadership of a cleric plays a central role in a particular articulation or not.;N
Declining the dominant traditionalist discourse, the alternative media have always strived to promote modernist discourse.;N
The alternative press media have conventionally played a vital role in the contemporary history of Iran, their highest peak coincides with the evolutionary periods that the rise against traditionalism becomes one of the essential axioms of social struggles to establish a more democratic political system.;N
Dissenting journalists were always the leading figures of 2000 [40] was just a link o dicating that Iran has a traditionalism.;N

Consequently, not o create a new open virtual modernist voices through Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 of educational written forms with which the composer attempts to familiarize the readers with social and moral thoughts by the application of travel anecdotes, though they are considered to be some pieces of prose literature nowadays.;N
The travelogues consist of the education of morality, social norms, wisdom, etc.;N
with lots of information derived from travel anecdotes that the composers observed or heard from somebody else.;N
The notion of totalitarianism is also embedded broadly in the Iranians’ ancient literature, as we can identify it in written pieces of Saadi of Shiraz, one of the most prominent composers of Iran in the medieval age.;N
For instance, he tells many of his travel anecdotes in “Gulistan,” chapter 7, concerning the effects of education.;N
However, he constantly emphasizes on the inability of ordinary people to become informed and knowledgeable.;N
He quotes from a king that “he whose foundation is bad will not take instruction from the good, to educate unworthy persons is like throwing nuts on a cupola” [43].;N
The king actually rejects the possibility of pedagogy concurrent with the medieval notation of education, as his preference is “to extirpate the race and offspring of these people and to dig up their roots and foundations”.;N
Consequently, the good (Saadi himself, or generally “Darvishes”) has to centralize his endeavor to educate the king by aphorism, as he names the first chapter of his book as “the manner of king”.;N
The combined thematic content of travelogues provides a foundational metaphor for the relationship between media and politics, contrary to the hypothetically so-called concept of “the 4th pillar of democracy” in the Western history of media in the nineteenth century.;N
At the advent of the modern era, Iranian intellectuals subsumed the notion of education into pedagogy in order to engender a new modern manner in the popu- expertise and knowledge t lishment of “Dar al-Fanu first university of Iran, the founder of Pahlavi Dynasty teenth century, Iranian int sued the project of raw mo were operating in the af Revolution, including the ments, as well as the solid and political conflicts cau power.;N

Furth would absolutely embrac perceived that any further gress and more despotism foresee how the new dicta emerge by the coup of 192 Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 new government was again highly concentrated on the process of coercive modernization and did not tolerate any opposition against its politics regarding the enforcement of modern norms.;N
After the 1978–1979 Islamic Revolution, when a short period of media freedom provided with the new revolutionary atmosphere passed, the focal metaphor around the essential function of media as educational apparatus remained unchanged and the new regime just changed some marginal components of this fundamental metaphor.;N
In his first public speech in Iran after 14 years living in exile, Ayatollah Khomeini stated that “Cinema is one of the civilization manifestation which has to serve to educate people”.;N
Along with the domination of Islamist discourses, the state regime legitimated the basic role of clerics or representatives to be in charge of educating people in all different aspects of social life, including the media practice, the pedagogical efforts in primary kindergartens, schools, universities, or other forms of unofficial education, like artistic activities and religious ceremonies.;N
Furthermore, the state regime determined that the Islamic values and approaches must be the main core of any kind of education, conveyed by media contents generated by different governmental and ideological organizations.;N
From the first months after the Islamic Revolution until now, the most crucial priority of the state regime concerning media has been focused on embedding Islamic values in media content in order to educate people in a top-down manner.;N
Although the influence and reliability of media platforms have been doubted in different points, enormous budgets have been spent on different media genre, like costly movies, to serve the main focal metaphor, which is still about educating people and has never changed.;N
On the other hand, the alternative media in Iran is also media forms and contents governmental media, tot itional discourses.;N
Thus, tween tradition and mod sphere, has been capable centuries, since they both to educate the public by m Conclusions In this article, we attem layers of causes that cons between media and polit tions of each layer have be and have been maintaine nections are also beneficia might be suggested by fo However, any given soluti practical, since different la issues to the more deeply promises take us into the cannot translate into a s though offering a soluti point out our rational res (Table 3), as it also sum layer of analysis.;N

C Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 according to the findings of the discourse/worldview layer.;N
Through the discourse scenarios, we are capable of understanding the general and fundamental differences of various alternative scenarios in the long-term future.;N
Moreover, we believe that discourse-based scenarios are relatively general and macro-level scenarios by which different audiences and interest groups can grasp the future’s conditions of media and politics in Iran and conduct their policy plans through this understanding.;N
While litany scenarios are more useful for managers and social cause scenarios are more beneficial for policy makers, discourse scenarios are constructed in a more academic manner and they are beneficial for grasping the long-term futures’ alternatives.;N
Table 4 illustrates the nutshell of three possible scenarios for the future of media and politics in Iran: The first scenario, “media struggle,” is the scenario which shows the continuous struggle between the traditionalist discourse and the modernist discourse.;N
In this scenario, Iran’s state regime remains semi-totalitarian and it continues to dominate, control, and suppress the media sphere.;N
While some private and commercial press and media continue to work and publish in the media struggle scenario, the state regime stays as the main actor which regulates and control independent media and supervises their content production to be in line with the regime’s ideological and political purposes.;N
The role of civil society as an actor in the relationship between media and politics in Iran remains fragile and insignificant, and it will not be able to make any considerable change in the media sphere.;N
This scenario illustrates the limited and small changes and innovations in the telecommunication technological aspects in Iran.;N
In other words, whether a revolutionary technological breakthrough emerges or not, the state regime will not to evolve from a semi-t democratic political system and the diverse media sp and acceptable.;N
Private an can work in a competition state regime will play the in practical aspects, instea media platforms.;N
In this formative communication come known and used am as well.;N
In this sense, the and surveillance in media The third scenario, “su nario of the supremacy of this alternative scenario, more totalitarian system o control over all aspects of state-owned media becom powerful with the help of vate and independent me and competitive enough t The civil society will be s and become more fragile sphere.;N

According of media effects, the medi what to think of rather t Talebian and Talebian European Journal of Futures Research (2018) 6:8 media and politics in Iran, like policy making, media coverage characteristics, media ownership, political censorship, and official versus satellite TV channels’ competition.;N
However, these scenarios are homogeneous in a way, because none of these explained significant disparities between modernist and traditionalist agenda violates the pervasive reality that there is one single and common myth behind both the competing discourses.;N
None of the traditionalism and modernism discourses represents itself to be singled out for some unique superiorities, nevertheless, they implicitly claim that people should learn to adhere to their universal values due to their usefulness, legitimacy, novelty, antiquity, etc., whether the instrumental device to accomplish this task is pedagogy or media.;N
In the emancipatory and desirable scenario, we are seeking a future in which the media play their role as the 4th pillar of democracy, where they just serve to inform rather than to educate.;N
In this alternative future, the political interest groups and the market or the state regime will be limited to echoing their voice throughout the public through their labeled and known media campaigns, while the independent and public media reflect the voice of the voiceless and deliver the marginalized groups’ demands to the powerful politicians and firms.;N
In other words, the futures scenarios that we previously constructed based on the results of the discourse level elucidate the explanatory alternative scenarios which possess a greater possibility of becoming the reality.;N
However, there is no limitation for a critical approach to consider a wider vision of the future in which the controversy between traditionalism and modernism in Iran ends, and instead, a balanced synthesis of tradition and modernity provides the prospect of a new postmodern relationship between media and politics in Iran.;N

Authors apply their research to tackle present challenges associated with the limited awareness of Foresight and constrained access to Foresight training offer in the region, which leads to insufficient Futures Literacy competences among managers and thus stiffens the opportunity to take advantage of Foresight in business practice.;N
The paper presents two perspectives of analyzing business futures.;N
A macro perspective, which concerns possible development scenarios of Visegrad economies, and a micro perspective, which concerns possible development scenarios of individual companies from Visegrad region.;N
The methodology for the macro analyses involves the discussion of the futures of business in Visegrad economies based on quantitative indicators related to trade balance, foreign direct investment and SMEs prevalence analysed over 2002 – 2014 analysis are based on the ex cise executed by Visegrad day international Foresight the results achieved so BMobilising Corporate countries^, which aims to b niques to managers, who a foresight evangelists^ in V Keywords Corporate fores literacy .;N

The above discussion is especially relevant to enterprises operating in Central and Eastern Europe1 (CEE) economies.;N
A self-evident argument, which can be used to explain this reluctant point of view towards Foresight is the preference (among CEE-based businesses) given to product and process technological innovations as opposed to organisational innovations [7].;N
However, the limited approval and low prevalence of Futures Literacy competences among managers or policy makers are not limited to Central and Eastern Europe but they characterize modern society in general as it is described by [8, 9].;N
This implies from futures researchers and consultants to embrace the following key aims: (1) To deliver high quality embodied Foresight output, such as: scenarios, roadmaps, visions, options, key priorities or actions, explanations of trends or weak signals etc.;N
[10, 11] (2) To enhance disembodied learning processes on individual and organisational levels, which would lead to revising the views of the world [1, 2], accepting uncertainty, triggering spontaneity and experimentation, and acting accordingly with/against changes/shocks [8, 9].;N
One of the means to provide the fertile environment to realise this two-fold Foresight mission is to teach the future [12].;N
Owing to the facts that: diverse foresight educational offer, which includes both: comprehensive, formal university degrees in Futures Studies, and non-formal education courses in Foresight2, is not evenly distributed across Europe as well as acknowledging that Futures Literacy [9] is a transversal – – The authors build on [14] and implement a allows to combine qu building methods, The analyses are in p 2017.;N

Certainly, the V4 countries put national sovereignty at the forefront of their priorities.;N
One of the tools, which is used by the V4 group to encourage mutual cooperation, is the International Visegrad Fund (IVF).;N
The fund supports the development of cooperation in culture, scientific exchange, research, education, exchange of students and development of cross-border cooperation and promotion of tourism.;N
The annual contributions to the fund by the governments of the Visegrad Group countries have had an increasing tendency: it rose from €3 million in 2004 to €8 million as of 2014.;N
It allows implementing a number of joint projects (in the V4 region and the neighbouring countries) particularly in the fields of culture, environment, internal security, defence, science and education.4 When discussing the future of business of the region, it is important to shed light on the main challenges facing the V4 countries.;N
OECD identifies these in a project that looks at the current prospects analyzing the trends in the last two decades, since the early ‘90s.;N

1 Combination of drivers and related scenarios.;N
(Source: Authors based on [14]) A comprehensive definition, which covers many characteristics proposed by others, is the one of [34]: Scenarios are consistent and coherent descriptions of alternative hypothetical futures that reflect different perspectives on past, present, and future developments, which can serve as the basis for action.;N
The method aims at presenting the possible, probable and preferable future visions and directions of development for a given country, region, organisation, or even technology.;N
Due to their flexibility and capacity, scenarios can be applied in numerous areas, e.g.;N
strategic management, environmental assessments for public policy, technological Foresight, etc.;N
[34, 52].;N
The authors decided to blend two approaches to futures thinking via development of scenarios: – The first – a macro perspective approach, which is about developing scenarios that relate to a specific issue or condition rather than to a particular organisation.;N
Scenarios – developed in this way and organisations with agement and decision The second– a micro p narios as a planning and od, where individuals (c ipants in the exercise an In addressing the first – authors have chosen to foll [14], who opted to use cou developing scenarios and bas of three key drivers of futu This allowed testing the so that assessed each key drive omy and allowed to match t scenarios.;N

Accessed 18.11.2016 Whereas in the second – micro perspective - approach, the authors followed a more intuitive logic, which is assumed to be a standard method in the building of scenarios [48].;N
In the literature it is described (synonymously) as two-dimensional matrix, scenario-axes technique, four-quadrant scenarios [34, 49].;N
The technique seeks to identify two key driving forces of the highest importance and impact on the development of the issue, region, or organisation under research.;N
The two key factors are then plotted on two axes, constructing four scenario quadrants – each representing a different perspective on how the future may unfold.;N
The authors have chosen to introduce company representatives to STEEPVL analysis to help them identify and elicit key driving forces around which individual companies’ scenarios were built.;N

 The combination of the above drivers’ alternatives resulted in eight different scenarios (Figs.;N

Each scenario is based on the combination of the two alternatives of the three drivers (as explained in [14]).;N
The model combination of drivers for each scenario is as follows: driver F1 [small business (+) or large business (−)] plus driver F2 [integrated economy (+) or disconnected economy (−)] plus driver F3 [embracing connectivity (+) or defensive towards connectivity (−)].;N

However, their role in national economies and internationalisation paths differ from country to country.;N
The key characteristic of Czech’s SMEs is their share in international supply chains, which results in sectorial shift towards manufacturing.;N
The share of Hungarian high-tech manufacturing firms and knowledge-intensive services provided by SMEs is only marginally lower than in the EU as a whole.;N
The value added that is generated by Polish SMEs is significantly lower, which is the evidence of their lower productivity and a concentration of Polish micro enterprises in low value-added sectors.;N
The performance of Polish SMEs in the knowledge-intensive service sector is also below the EU average.;N
Slovakia’s performance in the single market area is higher than the EU average.;N

This scenario may also lead to greater awareness of the need for sustainability of resources [14].^ However, after data update, which shows increased dynamics of integration of V4 countries with the international economy (as data related to trade balance and FDI show), the authors claim that after 10 years they are more to be falling into the Global Flexible Specialisation scenario (sceanrio 1, see above) (Fig.;N

The methodology for the workshop was based on the intuitive logic school [58] and comprised five research tasks (Fig.;N

First of all, the experts were asked to decide on the sector they operate in, the size of the company, the region of their business activity, technology and products they develop.;N
The experts chose the following sectors for the scenario analysis: machine industry, transportation in V4, 3D printing.;N
For the further analysis, the authors of the article have selected 3D printing.;N
The selection of the case to be described has been based on the criteria of data completeness.;N
The basic assumptions for 3D printing company are presented in Table 3.;N
The experts agreed on the name of the company, namely BDDD^ service provider.;N
They assumed that the company would represent SMEs sector with the size of 50 people employed.;N
For the company’s location they selected south Poland, at the same time they agreed that it competed globally (accordingly to Global Flexible Specialisation scenario).;N

By updating the quantitative drivers it is feasible to analyse the changes in the country/ scenario attribution as referenced in 2005 by [14].;N
In the paper such an update has been provided for Poland and Czech Republic.;N
One may also easily expand the analysis to cover a broader range of countries, than the 20 economies’ sample analysed by [14].;N
The paper provides original data for Hungary and Slovakia, which were not included in the original pole of countries analysed back in 2005.;N
Whereas, citing the workshop participants’ comments from evaluation questionnaires, the FOR_V4 scenario workshops based on structured methodology challenged experts’ mental models and offered a range of hunting issues related to their business activity development.;N
They were stressing the fact that finally they have been shown how to deal with complexity and what type of vocabulary is needed to think about the futures.;N
The authors of the article would like to stress once again that generating scenarios allows future possibilities to be investigated in a systematic manner, thus Bclarifying present action in the light of possible and desirable futures^ as posited by [59].;N
Furthermore, it seemed that the workshop method succeeded, as the project participants were eager to engage with the scenarios and explore hypothetical futures, which depended on clarity and transparency in the process of scenario building.;N
By combining a more quantitative-oriented macro perspective with a more expert-oriented micro perspective of building scenarios the authors of the paper have tried to curb the well-known limitations11 [described by 34, 49, 61] of the scenario-axes technique, which was the main method of the scenario building workshop.;N
Judging from the achieved results and taking into account the positive feedback received from the workshop participants, it seems that the method sufficiently met the goals of the project study: it revisited business sce- Open Access This article is Creative Commons Attributi creativecommons.org/license use, distribution, and reproduct appropriate credit to the origina to the Creative Commons licens References 1.;N

Keywords: Smart city, Smart home, Smart home technology services, Social barriers Introduction The world has witnessed an increasing accumulation of its people in urban areas since 1990.;N
This trend is not new and represents a substantial increase in urban residents’ number, from an approximate average of 57 million between 1990 and 2000 to 77 million between 2010 and 2015 [1].;N
It poses significant challenges for the environment and social sustainability.;N

It is crucial to note that city dwellers have contradictory comments about smart home applications.;N
According to the research findings, the way to overcome the social barrier and to communicate with state-of-theart technologies is the key worry of smart home residents.;N
This research aims to find the most concerning social issues for smart homeowners.;N
For this purpose, four European cities (Barcelona, Copenhagen, Berlin, and London) select as case studies.;N
Finally, this study suggests several recommendations to reduce identified social issues.;N
 Literature review Smart city The idea of smart cities was rooted in the 1970s when a digital configuration based on technology and nonmaterial structures embedded in the urban physical spaces.;N
Afterward, the new aspects of everyday life have been concentrating on more complex innovations.;N
Broadband networks and collective intelligence determining the city development supported these new technologies [5, 6].;N
There are different views regarding the origin of the concept of “smart city” in the literature.;N
According to Caragliu et al.;N
(2009), “The city could be smart when investments in human and social resources combined with traditional and modern ICT infrastructures boost sustainable economic growth and high quality of life, with wise natural resource management through participatory governance [7].” Globalization trends and emerging new technologies are increasingly influencing urban and regional environments.;N
ICTs are also heavily involved in the management and governance of cities.;N
Authorities and planners use these innovations as tools and services to promote the quality of life, promote a sustainable development, land use, communication vice delivery, and so fort strategy focusing on the I politan areas [11].;N
The te rently significant in the sm approaches focused on basis for a smart city.;N

It is a common strategy to achieve urban development and de-industrialized finance.;N
The utilization of development and social capital through “smart urban communities,” composed of firms, education, government, and individuals, depicts the smart city’s organization.;N
These communities benefited from ICT and human capital to engage all participants to innovate and beneficially alter the urban environment [14, 18, 19].;N
 recommendations for ach of smart homes.;N
One o implementing smart living principal goal is to comb agement to provide peop able, safe, accessible, and environment.;N
 Smart home definitions Smart city characteristics According to studies, a smart city would have five key components: contemporary technologies, buildings, utilities, transportation, and road infrastructure.;N
In terms of technology, a smart city is a long-term collaboration between government, government institutes, and private companies to develop and implement computerized platforms.;N
This cooperation is concerning with strengthening contemporary technologies, including mobile cloud computing, digital documents, networks, and emerging decision-making methods [20, 21].;N
Smart city notions are as broad as the number of smart cities.;N
Besides the three dimensions explained in Table 1, the following six characteristics should include “smart economy,” “smart people,” “smart governance,” “smart mobility,” “smart environment,” and “smart living” Those three dimensions influence the outcomes of the six characteristics.;N
Table 2 shows the theories and the characteristics of each of these six characteristics [14]: Smart living is one of the characteristics of the smart city, according to the table, and the crucial purpose of this component is to boost citizens’ quality of life.;N
There are also other aspects of smart living, such as education, safety, and social cohesion.;N

In other words, big data has a critical effect on several aspects of smart cities and, eventually, on citizens’ lives [29].;N
Smart city applications store information, and big data networks utilize this information.;N
Also, big data systems gather information and process it to enhance the multiple services of smart cities.;N
Big data will also help authorities to plan the development of smart city services.;N
There are numerous instances of big data applications that serve the smart cities: 1 Smart education: Through education facilities, ICT offers solutions for improving the quality, efficiency, and profitability of educational systems.;N
These facilities are adaptable in their use of information, better monitoring, and evaluation and expanded learning opportunities for citizens and stakeholders [30].;N
2 Smart traffic lights: one of the main features of smart cities is effective traffic flow control, which will improve transportation systems and improve the traffic patterns of citizens and the city as a whole [31].;N
3 Smart Grid: Smart grid is a vital component of smart cities.;N
It is a reconstructed network that gathers and operates on existing data, such as information about suppliers and customers’ behaviors, utilizing information, and communication technology in an integrated manner to incorporate values [32].;N
Smart cities and big data are two modern approaches.;N
Hence, numerous scientists have begun integrating them to develop smart city technologies that will enhance sustainability, improved resilience, efficient government, quality of life, and resource management.;N

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Within foresight management in general and scenario development in particular, the question is often asked: “For what scenario do I have to be prepared?” Since there are manifold approaches of scenario technique, the ways to answer this question with the help of scenario technique are also manifold.;N
Scenario approaches using probabilities, for example, would recommend emphasizing the most probabilistic scenario.;N
However, the consideration of probabilities, in our opinion, is not always useful.;N
From a combinatorial point of view, any given scenario has an infinitesimal probability of being right, since there are so many possible variations (Gee et al.;N
in Deep News Glob Bus Netw 2(4):199, 1991).;N
Additionally, when regarding all possible developments that may be relevant for a scenario, each development has only an infinitesimal probability of coming true.;N
Following these thoughts, the consideration of probabilities often has no additional benefit and, therefore, is not necessarily needed within scenario development.;N
In this paper, the use of probabilities in scenarios will be discussed.;N
On the one hand, this includes a discussion about scenarios in which the considerations do not make sense.;N
On the other hand, the paper will also show an prepared.;N

 27, Page 2 of 13 foresight activities can assist the company within the process of preparing for and focusing on the right topics in the future.;N
Foresight management can help to coordinate all the foresight activities within a company.;N
Foresight management, according to Ahuja et al.;N
[5], can be described as the capability to generate competitive advantages.;N
Salo, Könnöla and Hjelz [6] have a more detailed understanding and place emphasis on three objectives of foresight management.;N
These are the elemental outcomes of the foresight activity: improved system understanding, enhanced networking and strengthened innovation activities.;N
The success of foresight management itself depends on an adequate adoption and combination of analytical and communicative methods.;N
Another and more likely description, from our point of view, is presented by Amsteus [7].;N
He sees foresight as a behavior that is limited by cognitive variables with the aim of pointing out possible futures and clarification of emerging situations, this is underlined by the following statement: “There is no need to know the future, but to be prepared for the future” [39].;N
In addition to this understanding, we emphasize the knowledge aspect that accompanies foresight management.;N
In these terms, knowledge, for example, can be distinguished between one’s own knowledge itself, and metaknowledge, i.e.;N
the knowledge about one’s own knowledge (cf.;N
Fig.;N
1).;N
Hence, it can be distinguished between known knowns (uncritical), unknown knowns (“forgotten” or hidden knowledge), known unknowns (white spots in knowledge), and unknown unknowns (so-called black swans [8]).;N
Transferred to foresight management, the known unknowns are especially regarded – we know that there is a topic that we are unsure about and that this topic, therefore, has to be investigated.;N
In the context of foresight management, scenarios can be helpful when regarding (complex) future situations and problems.;N
Complex means that the problem regarded is influenced by many factors, that these factors are interlinked in a mani- strategy processes and imp cently been empirically pro However, recent researc professionalization by hig stronger scientific rigor an Wilkinson et al., for examp key insights from the theor ence into the pragmatic fie with theoretical grounding complex, messy and puzzlin research proposes cross-v (triangulation) [14–16], for scenario approaches may l and a surplus.;N
Thirdly, stro quantitative data in foresig methods have their strength [16–18].;N
Some scenario developer developed scenarios [19].;N
Th to a scenario creates an expe the aim of scenario planning the one presented, do not us are considerable disadvantag for example, probability rati jective [21].;N

In this manner, very probable scenarios with high consistencies should be preferred.;N
Since we think that the disadvantages of the use of probabilities outweigh the respective advantages – and, therefore, that no probabilities should be used – we will present an alternative approach: focusing on the most relevant scenario(s).;N
This concept combines the concept of consistency with the concepts of attributes and closeness.;N
In this context, we use an inductive approach.;N
 Scenario development omitting probabilities Three major subjects where probabilities may actually be used can be identified when regarding the scenario development: the scenario creation process, the scenarios themselves and the scenario controlling.;N
It will be argued in the following why the use of probabilities for each subject should be avoided.;N
Case 1: “the consideration of probabilities is not meaningful within the process of scenario creation” Firstly, probabilities can be used within the process of scenario creation, i.e.;N
probabilities are used for the calculation of the scenarios.;N
In these terms, the rating of the probabilities themselves is the issue most discussed [28].;N
As has already been mentioned, these ratings are often characterized as subjective [21, 29], are based on the specific know-how of the people doing the evaluating [30] or are difficult to obtain [26].;N
These circumstances can be intensified by a growing complexity of the subject regarded [29].;N
Thereby, the number of ratings is twice as high compared to approaches that use consistencies.;N
This requires scenario developers or experts with a high willingness and ability to estimate the probabilities [26].;N
Furthermore, the experts who perform the ratings are often and more impactful – for individual who does the ev Case 2: “assigning probabi does not make sense” Secondly, having calculat described by a specific pro probabilities, for example, probability ratings of the ev in a qualitative process (e.g follows the scenario creatio According to Reilja, a sc but rather a more or less p This is also the opinion o They point out that assigni narios does not match the possible future and not pre [34].;N

 Case 3: “working with pro controlling is not beneficia Thirdly, a controlling pro creation process – where p 27, Page 4 of 13 As to this, such wild card-dominated scenarios would not be considered.;N
Following Reibnitz, a consideration of probabilities is not beneficial [41].;N
This can be attributed to the subjective character of the assessment [30] and, furthermore, these assessments often represent only a snapshot of the current situation.;N
The consideration of probabilities also depends heavily on the experience and knowledge of the risk perceptions of the scenario team [30].;N
On the one hand, relevant disruptive events for the company have a tendency to be underestimated by the scenario team [41].;N
On the other hand, it is observed that probabilities are often overestimated from a company’s point of view.;N
 The most important scenario As the disadvantages that accompany the use of probabilities, in our opinion, dominate the respective advantages, in the following, an alternative course of action – focusing on the most important scenario – will be presented.;N
Consequently, different sets of scenarios have to be regarded.;N
The cross-interpretation of the different sets finally allows for the identification of the most important scenario.;N
The course of action will be shown by an application example: “future study of the automotive supplier industry in South Westphalia” [42].;N
In fact, the study was performed in 2009.;N
It was initiated by the University of Siegen and tried to identify future needs for the local automotive supplier industry around the university.;N
Since the time horizon back then was set to 2015, some scenario elements, of course, are prevalent today or have already appeared.;N
In 2009, for example, we identified a differentiated scenario for the global development (“Crossroads”) that could be more or less noticed after the economic crisis that started in 2008.;N

Thereby, it is valid to think in extremes, that means, “What might happen, what is thinkable?” In this context, a wide search and the consideration of characteristics in the phase of system design is necessary.;N

If a characteristic does not occur at the expected date, this is a first indication to verify the assumptions of the scenario development process.;N
When the first characteristics occur, the process of action should slowly start, depending on the priority of the characteristics.;N
At the point when the last characteristic of a scenario occurs, it is absolutely necessary to act.;N
With this in mind, it is obvious that dealing with probabilities cannot achieve a foresight system in this way.;N

 27, Page 12 of 13 Limitations and future work The process of scenario development has indeed been well investigated, nevertheless, there are a number of outstanding points which should be further researched.;N
These include, for example, the choice of characteristics and their attributes.;N
At this point, the following questions arise: “When do I have the right and the right number of characteristics?” and “Are all thinkable developments of attributes considered?” A further outstanding point is the evaluation of the matrices by the scenario team.;N
Everyone who takes part in the evaluation process holds another position or perspective to the respective topic.;N
This often causes the evaluation to be subjective.;N
At this point, the following questions arise: “How can the subjective character be invalidated?” and “How can the uncertainty in the evaluation process be handled?” Future research will have to deal with the points listed among other things.;N

This question is pertinent, as doubts about the future are increasing engage with the future is not sufficiently addressed by the quantitative growth of future change, for example, the future consequences of global temperature increase are well-k action accordingly.;N
While some see the use of art as an effective means to engage with usage as reducing art to an instrumental value, at the expense of aesthetic values.;N
This r about how art and imagination can be engaging and what this implies for future studie To address the issue, we resort to a pragmatist understanding of art.;N
We present a readin (1859–1952).;N
In his Art as Experience, Dewey claimed that art can be seen as a “mode of p and statistics”.;N
He presents the experience of art as a reciprocal process that is imaginativ art, we experience the artwork, while the experience also produces us.;N

Keywords: Engagement, Future studies, Art theory, John Dewey, Aesthetics van Lente and Peters ﻿European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:16 To address the issue of engagement, we resort to a pragmatist understanding of art, where the aesthetic value and the everyday implications of art are not opposed, but seen as part of the same move.;N
We present a reading of the work of John Dewey (1859–1952).;N
In his Art as Experience (1934), Dewey claimed that art can be seen as a “mode of prediction not found in charts and statistics”.;N
He presents the experience of art as a reciprocal process that is imaginative: in our engagement with art, we experience the artwork, while the experience also produces us.;N
The aesthetic experience is transformative.;N
This mutual coming into existence is not a planned creation, but insinuates an open future as well as an open past.;N
As a next step, we use Dewey’s understanding of the aesthetic experience to review how in future studies imaginations are mobilised in the production of futures and how engaging, or transformative, that can be.;N
First, we look at methods to produce futures: extrapolations, Delphi Surveys, surveys, simulations and scenarios.;N
Second, we evaluate how the produced futures themselves may engage their audience, distinguishing between narratives, symbols, graphs and images.;N
We conclude that while futures studies have been successful in offering accounts of the future, ranging from mechanically produced futures of extrapolations to the narratives that constitute scenarios, future studies also have difficulties to relate to futures in a more open, imaginative and responsible way.;N
The difficulty to engage is a serious problem, given the urgency of societal concerns, such as the climate crises.;N
 Using art to engage with the future Since its start, future studies have emphasised the importance of engaging with the future to enhance control and to improve choices, nevertheless, this ambition to engage their imagination, climate rethinking the role of hum The rise of so-called c debates on its artistic qu it embodies a propagand artistic practice.;N

When McKibben called upon artists to approach the climate problem with their imagination, he implicitly reproduced the idea that artists are free to use their imagination in order to produce art that allows us to rethink our role as humans.;N
This could be seen as a form of outreach to engage the public with the results of (climate) future studies, instrumentalising art and reproducing a divide between art and science at the same time.;N
Critical art theory looks beyond the current art world, and analyses how art supports the given order and reproduces the conditions of capitalism.;N
Rather than stressing their autonomy and politically neutralising their art, artists should acknowledge that their work is the product of a society, yet also strive for new languages of art that are in a critical, or dialectical tension with this society.;N
To move beyond the dualism of autonomy and instrumentalism, we want to explore in an alternative art theory (the third row in Table 1) , one that allows a different understanding of how the arts may offer new ways of engaging with the future.;N
Below, we present a reading of the work of John Dewey on aesthetic experiences as a starting point to reflect on how future studies can engage.;N
 Dewey on art: the transformative experience The pragmatist American philosopher John Dewey (1859–1952) is famous for his studies on education and democracy, while he also made important contributions to the philosophy of art.;N
He starts his argument in Art as Experience (1934) from the observation that works of art are usually understood in their external and physical existence, detached from the actual life-experience from which they emerge and in which they have consequences.;N
This detachment is a fallacy, Dewey argues, which he ([3] [1934].;N

For Dewey, im art: when old and familiar van Lente and Peters ﻿European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:16 new and the old (p.;N
283).;N
According to Dewey, imagination is opposed to habituation.;N
Trains of thought are precisely that: too easy.;N
Habituation has a constricting effect (p.;N
278).;N
That which is not directly present in the experience of the here and now can only be present in the imagination.;N
Precisely the fact that the present is never a literal copy of the past, every conscious perception of the present presents us with a risk, a movement towards the unknown, and where the past merges into the present there is also a reconstruction of the that past.;N
Dewey uses the term ‘mechanical’ as a quality that signifies moments when past and presence fit exactly together (p.;N
284).;N
In that sense, a work of art is can never be mechanical.;N
It not only is an outcome of imagination, but it operates imaginatively (p.;N
285).;N
In order to perceive something aesthetically, Dewey argues, implies that we integrate past experiences into new patterns (p.;N
144).;N
Retelling the stories of our past experiences in the present to give them new meanings is what precludes their rigid predetermination.;N
Precisely because the past is not stable and continuously rewritten, we can create new stories out of it.;N
It is in this ‘consummatory phase of experience’ that something new is presented.;N
“This fact sets the insuperable barrier between mechanical production and use and esthetic creation and perception.;N
In the former there are no ends until the final end is reached.;N
Then work tends to be labour and production to be drudgery.;N
But there is no final term in appreciation of a work of art.;N
It carries on and is, therefore, instrumental as well as final.” (p.;N
145) Important here is what Dewey says about instrumentalism.;N
It is often used in a limited way, as a kind of utility such as an umbrella can be instrumental.;N
Art is instrumental in a more comprehensive way, Dewey argues.;N

In Delphi studies, futures are produced by following experts in several rounds of participation, articulation and reflection [29].;N
Typically, it involves a range of experts to sketch a future of a domain, a sector.;N
Because it draws on ‘expert knowledge’, these futures highlight the distinction between those who can have a say and those who have not.;N
This, in its turn, can be taken as a prompt to silence other ideas and hopes—and to mechanically follow the logic of the experts.;N
Alternatively, the collective view of the expert may surprise and give rise to countervailing accounts.;N
Surveys come with their own mark of credibility.;N
As they construe futures by following and ordering responses, the present a view not just of a future, but also of its inhabitants [29].;N
Often, the surveys do not just present the collective outcomes, but bring some distinctions in the populations: men versus women, rich versus poor, higher educated versus less educated, etcetera.;N
Here, the spectator may feel alienated from the inner logics that apparently guide the displayed groupings, or, alternatively, identify with the responses, which, subsequently, may lead to a reshuffling of the future.;N
Instead of following people, futures can be produced by following mathematical models.;N
Simulations bring together many variables and their relationships— derived from empirical research or stipulated when such evidence is lacking—to represent the present and construct a future [27].;N
As the mathematical infrastructure and the informed distribution of variables and values of the simulated future tends to be hidden, the outcome is manifested as factual: those are the numbers.;N
It is an external world, finished, without the need course of events, the fut When the futures promp provide a surprising ho might also enable a future Scenarios typically com are produced by followin tions [31].;N

So, in p in different thought exper based on extremes, they a be left as they are foreign.;N
Table 2 Summarises ou futures, evaluated by th derived from Dewey’s re thetic experiences.;N
A second way to review not engage, is to conside futures.;N
Here we resort t [34] introduced to discu The basic idea is that fu a beginning and an end, protagonists in a setting— formative [10, 23].;N
Storyl and by doing so, guide th ments of organisations [2, late in societies at large, f public decision-making [5 van Lente and Peters ﻿European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:16 Table 3 Ingredients of futures Containing a storyline Elements of a story-line Text based Narrative with plot, script, protagonist Symbol shared representation of value and preferred directions Object based Graph Image connecting past, present and the design and staging future (by extrapolation) of an artefact points to desired futures Source: Van Lente [34] also be presented and circulated as texts (documents, narratives, web pages, speeches) or as objects (graphs, pictures, prototypes).;N
These two distinctions create four categories: narratives, symbols, graphs and images, see Table 3.;N
The first category of futures, narratives, can be engaging when they unsettle the reader and reshuffles his or her earlier narratives.;N
Yet, when narratives are successful, that is, when they are used and accepted widely, they typically align with existing storylines—and are then less surprising [11].;N
Think about the Grand Challenges in EU science and innovation policy, which bring narratives (futures) of Europe competing with the USA and China, of an ageing population in Europa, about the need to have a sustainable agriculture.;N
Such narratives are useful and they make sense, but they have been told and retold, and thus, according to Dewey’s notions of aesthetic experiences, will not be engaging.;N
The second category, symbols, refers to shared values and preferred directions.;N
Symbols, like freedom or equality, may figure in storylines, but do not offer storylines themselves.;N
Like successful narratives, they are readily available and easily recognised.;N
For this reason, symbols past, present and future ‘hockey stick’ graph about ryline of human civilisatio Graphs, however, are line resentation of something easily includes the reader.;N

His derives from the imaginat sense of moral responsib it.;N
In the final chapter of lization’, Dewey reiterates oped in the first chapter: experience—which consis live creature and environm van Lente and Peters ﻿European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:16 present between people, but also historically between ours and earlier civilisations.;N
Communication presupposes a community of experience that we see in language, for example, and art is a more universal language than others, think of the example of music (p.;N
349).;N
Dewey makes the comparison with how we understand someone in a friendship: we can know a lot about someone, but that knowledge only becomes friendship if it is the result of sympathy through the imagination (p.;N
350).;N
At the end of the chapter, Dewey makes important remarks about the relationship between morality and imagination.;N
“The moral office and human function of art can be intelligently discussed only in the context of culture.” (p.;N
358).;N
Science based on facts projects the regularity of that past into the future.;N
“Factual science may collect statistics and make charts.;N
But its predictions are, as has been well said, but past history reversed.;N
Change in the climate of the imagination is the precursor of the changes that affect more details of life.” (p.360).;N
Change that comes from imagination is of a very different nature.;N
The problem of the relationship between morality and art is often placed on the side of art: we could do without art, but not without morality.;N
But that is not true, Dewey claims, imagination is the chief instrument of the good.;N
Dewey identifies the problem as resulting from the compartmentalisation of morality and art in different ‘departments’, in different economic and political institutions.;N
What is true of the individual is true of the whole system of morals in thought and action.;N
Every sense of goal and purpose are of necessity imaginative.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:1 Unsurprisingly, in the recent years, one of the EU’s flagship education programmes has been Erasmus+ 2014–2020, an initiative aimed at promoting a sense of European identity and citizenship among higher education students via intra-European mobility experiences.;N
In addition to pursuing the European Union’s need to compete in the global sphere, forging ‘global citizenry’, the rationale behind this programme is the belief that by bringing young Europeans together, a sense of European identity can be fostered [37, 38].;N
For its foreseen continuation spanning the 2021–2027 period, which has been allocated sizable budgetary increases, the legislative proposal drafted by the European Parliament reasserts that learning mobility contributes to strengthening European identity, principles and values and to bolstering a more democratic Union.;N
In light of the above, an exhaustive summary of current empirical evidence relevant to university students’ perceived European civic and cultural identity, with particular focus on the outcomes of educational programmes and on other factors that may facilitate or hinder its advancement, become highly relevant.;N
The construction of the European collective identity European identity has been defined by political theorists as ‘a psycho-sociological or socio-political process of attachment to the European space or to the political community designed by integration’ ([6], translated by [28]).;N
From an anthropological perspective, European identity is a collective identity which is accepted by individuals who share fundamental ethnic and civic similarities, being bound by a common historical heritage and feeling reciprocal solidarity [2].;N
This triple civic, spatial and ethnocultural domain of identification with Europe has been addressed by EC/EU and life projects, are also d ive identity-formation.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:1 Method Selection of the corpus The criteria for considering studies for this review referred to the types of studies, the types of participants and the types of phenomena of interest analysed.;N
Due to the scope of the topic dealt with, our review focuses on findings of qualitative research, which “provide much more detailed in-depth information about meanings of interventions and of behaviours” ([25], 77).While surveys and other quantitative tools may include questions on identity, qualitative methods are better suited for assessing the placement or fluidity of perceived borders between these identities and the meaning attributed to certain identities.;N
This review encompasses the results obtained from qualitative primary research studies, as well as qualitative findings extracted from mixedmethod inquiries.;N
Eligible studies were identified in a 3-step process, conducted by two reviewers.;N
First, an electronic database search was performed, supplemented by hand searching.;N
The electronic search was conducted in Proquest, Scopus and WOs from database inception to 30 May 2018.;N
No date or geographical restrictions were imposed, although the challenges associated with translating papers reporting qualitative research limited our selection to articles published in languages spoken by at least two members of the review team (i.e.;N
French, English and Spanish).;N
The search strategy was guided by two main elements, European university students and their identification with Europe, following this syntax:  TI,AB,IF(“European identity” OR “European identification”) AND TI,AB,IF(“supranational identity” OR “global identity” OR “supranational Second, the full text of to be relevant was retriev based on the review’s incl ond screening, 19 articles of data or focusing on a p students were excluded.;N

Issues regarding inclusion of new member states were tackled without the interviewer mentioning a specific nationality, yet all interviewees chose the example of Turkey and Turkish immigrants to illustrate their notions of the EU, based on shared concerns about the human rights situation in that country, its remote geographical location and presumably different religious background [26].;N

One study argued that European identification relies on pre-existing national identifications on the social representations of the relations between the EU and the subordinate geopolitical entity [17].;N
Authors also propose that we should think of students as having identity layers, corresponding to their local, national, European and global affiliations (Erling, 2007).;N
These layers of identity are often hierarchised in students’ minds and though national identity feelings are commonly stronger, most participants revealed their European identity feelings national identifications ([7 to European identity not place of identification, bu of social distinction ([7, 34 Byram [1] and Udrea [3 dents tend to assimilate student’ identities, consi Encounters with internati a self-reflection and incr Cores-Bilbao et al.;N

In some cases, students actualized a European sense of self because of the fact that they were perceived as Europeans in a foreign environment or when in contact with non-Europeans in their own country, prompting a distinctive European identity to emerge [18, 35].;N
Under these circumstances, mobile students sometimes added another layer to their identity negotiation process: that of migrant [10].;N

Similarly, social groups are most likely to identify with Europe if they have something to gain by doing so [34].;N
A predominant theme tackled by studies is the perceived importance of freedom of movement and the elimination of custom controls when crossing internal frontiers in respondents’ minds [1, 8, 24, 35].;N
Mobility is of such importance that it encouraged several students to re-define themselves as European benefits are academic, ed tunities [1, 33, 35], emplo right to reside without re try, the prerogative to tak travelling to other EU cou payments seamlessly anyw thetical transfer of compe Table 9 CERQual evidence profile.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:1 regarding a European army which would undertake shared defence efforts) was sometimes also based on utilitarian considerations [26].;N
Finding 8 supports that speaking foreign languages favours identification with supranational identities and Europe (Table 10).;N
Three studies that examined this issue ascertained that students who expressed an above-average feeling of attachment to Europe generally also regarded language skills as a key factor for establishing transnational relations and developing a cosmopolitan sense of belonging to many different places ([7, 9, 32]).;N
Similarly, one study concludes that individuals who are members of the ‘cultural bourgeoisie’, who hold a high degree of further education and are oriented to knowledge of foreign languages, society and cultures, are more likely to positively identify with Europe [34].;N
By contrast, one study [11] found that respondents who held a European identity rarely attributed their affiliation to studying European languages or to their higher education, and instead ascribed it to events that occurred much earlier in their biographies, such as friendships, shared experiences, emotions and meaningful communication with European nationals from other countries.;N
However, foreign language learning is generally considered as a facilitator of European identity, as people seek opportunities of exchange and communication with nationals of other countries or cultures through foreign languages [32].;N
The connection between multilingualism and European identity is also addressed by two studies.;N
Thus, command marker of affinity with multilingual identity [7].;N

However, the results of individual studies greatly fluctuate on their appraisal of academic sojourns abroad.;N

One study conc Table 12 CERQual evidence profile.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:1 sojourns was limited to fostering positive feelings towards the culture of the host territory and towards the home country, but not towards Europe as a whole [18].;N
In Llurda’s work (2016), the extent of the impact correlates to the level of Europeanness of the host country.;N
Thus, students sojourning in the ‘least European country’ (the UK) feel they would probably experience a deeper feeling of Europeanness elsewhere, like in countries such as Belgium or Germany.;N
Two studies reported the detrimental effects of foreign country academic experiences caused by indifferent and occasionally hostile attitudes of students in the host country.;N
In this sense, informants either expressed the difficulty to gain access to the people and cultures of their host countries [24] or negative rhetoric encountered abroad.;N
‘The overarching negativity in the host society ultimately results in strengthening participants’ sense of national belonging’ (Genova [10], 8).;N
Llurda also referred a heightened sense of national identity post experience abroad.;N
The results suggest that the detrimental effects could be minimised by inducting exchange students into the social and academic life of the host community [24].;N
Finding 11 reveals that exposure through leisure or spontaneous travel to Europe facilitates students’ European identification (Table 13) The relevance of boundary-crossing experiences and international travelling is highlighted as a means to achieving open-mindedness, curiosity and identity changes or identities in flux (hybridity and nonexclusivity in national and regional identities), which may facilitate the adoptio Two studies report an e sonal experiences of stay prominent inclusion of a identity ([9] [32]).;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2020) 8:1 As much as a valuable tool for intercultural understanding, the command of foreign languages is recurrently identified as a predictor of endorsement of the EU.;N
In fact, mobile students display more pro-European attitudes than their non-mobile fellows, but whether this results from the experience abroad or predates it is an unsettled issue.;N
Foreign language learning is generally acknowledged for its contributing effect to inter-personal communication and socialisation during transnational experiences, leading to the development of cosmopolitan dispositions.;N
In this sense, the EU’s continuing commitment with plurilingual education seems to be particularly fitting for the promotion of European citizenship.;N
Both academic sojourns and leisure transnational experiences chiefly have a positive impact on the students’ perceptions about the EU and broaden their own civic and cultural identities, however, either of them would benefit from intentional pedagogical interventions to fully address the current discussion on the future of Europe.;N
By supplementing the students’ European cultural capital and equipping them for the challenges of globalism, complexity and the unequal distribution of opportunities throughout European societies, education has the means to better prepare young citizens for intercultural dialogue and democratic participation.;N
Some implications for further research need also to be mentioned.;N
From a heuristic perspective, the need for researcher reflexivity in future qualitative studies on the phenomena of interest examined in this review has been established.;N
Regarding the thematic categories analysed, it is deemed that more detail concerning setting and participants is also needed to identify underlying cultural or social phenomena (shared values or beliefs) that mediate the influence of study programmes abroad.;N

The theoretically sound and differentiated concepts are increasingly being political practice by authoritarian populists and polarising pushers who try to pull the un tear society apart.;N
Two essential agreements of the post-war period are increasingly bein European consensus, which considers European unification as an essential achievement and the democratic consensus, which states that representative democracy is the undis ment.;N
In this article, after an introductory definition of polarisation, two future scenarios “Polarised Europe”, polarisation is extrapolated into the future and discussed with its seri democratic and European consensus.;N
The second scenario “Democratised Europe” show tive cosmopolitanism can mitigate polarisation and what steps could possibly be taken more democratic direction.;N
Keywords: Democracy, Polarisation, Cosmopolitanism, Communitarianism, Europe, Eur Introduction: The end of the European and the democratic consensus The history of most Western European states after 1945 and most central or Eastern European states after 1989 is characterised by two main agreements of its elites and citizens: a democratic consensus and a European consensus [3, 29, 31, 35].;N
The democratic consensus refers to the broad endorsement of representative democracy, Communities and later th time, these two agreemen up the smouldering lines crises of recent years, wh they are now erupting and visible polarisation [22].;N
Th and democracy are suppo ferentiate towards the pol Pausch E﻿ ur J Futures Res (2021) 9:12 two consensuses is thought further into the future and scenarios are presented to show what consequences are possible.;N
After introductory theoretical considerations on the connection between polarisation and democracy and the cleavage between cosmopolitanism and communitarianism, two scenarios are presented: In scenario 1 “Polarised Europe”, polarisation leads to the erosion of democracy and the European integration process.;N
In scenario 2, “Democratised Europe”, the contradictions between communitarian and cosmopolitan ideas are dialectically resolved with a concept of relative cosmopolitanism, structural reforms and concrete democratic innovations.;N
 Polarisation between communitarian and cosmopolitan positions In political science, polarisation refers to a state or process of hardened differences of opinion that are based on perceived or actual inequalities ([15], 693).;N
In pluralistic societies, conflicts are immanent.;N
The purpose of democracies is not to cover up existing conflicts, but to discuss them constructively and transparently.;N
In this respect, a certain degree of polarisation is not only normal but necessary in democracies.;N
However, the challenge is to prevent polarised conflicts from sliding into violent confrontation where dialogue comes at its end.;N
There are a number of theories that explain political polarisation processes.;N
The theory of pluralism assumes that different worldviews and political interests are normatively legitimate and are to be negotiated in a model of democratic governance.;N
To this end, Richard Bellamy has described four constitutional forms, which in turn are based on different political theory models [6].;N
Constitutional neutrality means that compromise is achieved by trimming and that the constitution is neutral towards world views.;N
 hardening of group identit is why the fourth constitu lamy—“Compromise as N suitable for the mitigation tionalism since it acknow on dialogue.;N

date the clashes of prefere with pluralism by seeking view the concerns raised rather than constraints to tactical concessions” (ibid based approach fits with a dialogue, deliberation and decades has been strongly mas [26].;N
Although Bella cussed and criticised Hab patriotism elsewhere [7], t democracy must be based of the other [25].;N
Later in mas’ discourse theory are In any case, dealing with central questions of demo ticularly true for the twen this dealing with conflict tions, which are themselv aspect of social division i ment of theoretical conce misuse.;N
We have been ex Pausch E﻿ ur J Futures Res (2021) 9:12 Cosmopolitan assumptions assume the possibility of universal democracy and a negotiation process that can be described with Juergen Habermas [24] as procedural rationality which does not presuppose any cultural preconditions.;N
The philosophical and political theoretical definitions of cosmopolitanism [2, 4, 44] are almost always based on an inclusive conception of the world, universalist ideas in which all people are granted equal rights.;N
In recent years, cosmopolitanism is also closely linked to ecological questions [13].;N
But despite the claim of global solidarity and equality among political thinkers of cosmopolitanism, political actors who represent cosmopolitan ideas in the political party spectre or in civil society and NGOs sometimes ignore socio-economic conditions of poorer milieus and underestimate achievements of nation state democracy [41].;N
This can drive polarisation and de facto exclude certain groups from political discourse [45].;N
In terms of political theory, one could argue that the two schools of thought serve different human needs: communitarians prioritise belonging to a nation or a political entity, while cosmopolitans prioritise equal freedom for all people [20, 48].;N
In this article, the distinction does not stand for all political-theoretical facets of the two schools of thought.;N
Rather, they describe the misuse in the political debate that is based on fundamental orientations and worldviews.;N
That is why I will use the terms exclusive communitarianism and dogmatic cosmopolitanism to avoid confusing the practical aberrations with the differentiated theoretical concepts.;N
For Wolfgang Merkel, this new line of conflict is emerging as a growing cleavage between winners and losers of globalisation.;N
While the former are mostly well educated and wealthy, the latter suffer from the risks of globalisation because they have less capital and resources and are In this article, I draw o globalisation is a key facto mopolitan and communit and Europe.;N
But I assume of winners and losers of whether people tend to lea in a dialectical understa needs are opposed to each sented by the two [20].;N
Co need for belonging and se is more oriented towards sal solidarity.;N
With reference to the th lion [48] and a relative ism [28], I assume that torn between two needs belonging.;N
Polarisation pr contradiction, as can be communitarianism and co between the two needs fal can happen quickly due t equality, polarisation occu the conflict is offered by t tive or rebellious cosmopo between communitarians political equality and by democracy and dialogue.;N
As I argued elsewhere, that the individual rebellio inequality is rooted in an ence and expresses itself strangers [12, 48].;N
This co the hybris of being a winn nomic cosmopolitanism, [4, 59].;N
Patrick Hayden de Pausch E﻿ ur J Futures Res (2021) 9:12 real life experiences and competences of democracy, dialogue and citizenship education.;N
Basis characteristics of polarisation In a complex world where there are no simple explanations, the risk of polarisation increases.;N
Unequal power relations, socio-economic inequality, structural marginalisation, discrimination or exclusion of certain groups can drive its pernicious forms.;N
The polarisation we encounter today thus has an existential basis, the contradiction between the need for freedom and that for belonging.;N
Four features characterise polarisation processes [49].;N
* Discrepancy of opinions: Two clearly identifiable and profiled opinions oppose each other.;N
These opinions are not compatible and configure themselves in an either/or relationship.;N
The communitarians aim at a narrower concept of belonging, the cosmopolitans at a broad understanding in which individual freedom and solidarity are thought globally and universally.;N
* Group formation: The two opinions are held by two different groups whose members are aware of the discrepancy and feel they belong to one of the two groups.;N
The world is divided into “Us versus Them” [9].;N
Political opponents are increasingly becoming antagonists [36] or even enemies.;N
Carl Schmitt’s friend-enemy scheme has recently received greater attention again [40, 56].;N
In political science, the term “affective polarisation” refers to the mutual dislike of the groups (cf.;N
[33]).;N
What is necessary is the awareness that one’s own opinion is one pole in a spectrum that can contain many opinions and that one’s position is represented by a group that is visible in some way.;N
Often these groups give themselves a name, or names are attributed to them.;N
With regard to positioning on the EU, we know the attributions as pro- and antiEuropeans or Eurosceptics.;N
With regard to positioning advocate a European repu bility of renationalisation.;N
* Political struggle: The f tioned is that a political waged in order to speak o ence of major differences cally relevant, because it one of the groups or eve without engaging in a poli is a dispute in public can w However, polarisation p as dangerous or endange certain extent, they are pa torically, polarisation pro precondition for social ch Polarisation often starts f tom-up.;N
When social mov tice or opportunities for t fight against it, a hardenin at first, as the dominant o ened and may reject the d sure of the social movem leads to a concession can democratisation.;N
For this t cess must be turned arou and inclusion (cf.;N

It is often driven a Pausch E﻿ ur J Futures Res (2021) 9:12 on experiences of democracy and on offers of dialogue.;N
The actors of polarisation are divided into pushers and followers who have an interest in division, seek scapegoats and use manipulative communication techniques.;N
In contrast, the so-called bridge builders can counteract this by promoting democracy and dialogue at various political levels [9].;N
Polarisation and the end of the democratic consensus The democratic consensus of the post-war period was based on the conviction that democracy was the only form of government that is acceptable.;N
This consensus was upheld in the political party landscape of Western Europe and, after 1989, largely in Eastern Europe as well.;N
Although there were very different ideas and forms of democratic systems in detail, from a semi-presidential French democracy to a parliamentary form in many other states and further gradations, the basic idea of representative democracy was not in question.;N
This changed in the 1990s and finally reached its peak in the last years.;N
Although there is still a very high percentage of people favouring democracy over all other forms of government in opinion surveys, there is a lot of evidence for a consequent, subversive decline of approval for democracy if we look at other indicators.;N
Not only is the number of parties questioning the democratic consensus increasingly [54], but the desire for a strong leader who does not need to care about parliament or election is also growing [29].;N
Satisfaction with, trust in and approval of representative democracy and its actors are also declining.;N
Thus, all these factors are eroding the democratic consensus.;N
This mood, a rising inequality and a general uncertainty related to the phenomena of individualisation, but also to concrete, existential experiences of crisis, promote politicisation and polarisation [41].;N
Authoritarian popu- Polarisation and the end of The second basic conse which has been wavering now, is the European co always some opponents to ject, they were largely ma [31].;N

In Pausch E﻿ ur J Futures Res (2021) 9:12 Democracy and Europe: two scenarios In the following, two possible scenarios are considered in a descriptive manner and on the basis of a few indicators.;N
These are narrative scenarios that are intended to describe plausible developments in a qualitative way and to show what would be expected in the event of changes in individual indicators.;N
In doing so, a rough structure is used and the complexity of reality is greatly reduced.;N
The aim of this approach is to highlight orientation points for future developments and the significance of the chosen individual indicators.;N
The indicators chosen for the narrative scenarios relate to two interrelated goals and principles of democracy: political equality and attitudes towards democracy.;N
These in turn affect the principles of freedom and control as described in the Democracy Barometer [11].;N
The scenarios describe how the polarisation between communitarian and cosmopolitan positions would develop based on the indicators of political equality and democratic attitudes.;N
In the first (Scenario 1: Polarised Europe), there is a further polarisation between exclusive communitarian and dogmatic cosmopolitan ideas.;N
The second scenario “Democratised Europe” shows how the concept of rebellious cosmopolitanism could be used to achieve a mediating and democracy-promoting alternative.;N
Scenario 1: Polarised Europe—exclusive communitarianism and dogmatic cosmopolitanism In the first scenario “Polarised Europe”, I assume that in the polarisation process the nationalist arguments become increasingly strong.;N
The battle for the undecided voters is heating up.;N
The main social and political problems like structural inequality and a lack of democratic experiences remain and help polarising pushers to mobilise followers and find scapegoats among immigrants and themselves.;N
Right-wing na Greens and liberals at th conservatives are also ma issues.;N

They see pluralism as internationalism and su and any restriction of nat Pausch E﻿ ur J Futures Res (2021) 9:12 attempts to supranationalise or even globalise democracy.;N
Cosmopolitans demand a European republic in which states no longer play a decisive role [23].;N
Some want to largely detach democracy from its representative structures with direct democratic procedures to replace them.;N
In this context, little attention is paid to the fact that socio-structural inequality also contributes to inequality in democratic procedures, since certain competences to assert one’s own interests are less pronounced among the poorly educated.;N
They are less used to speaking publicly, presenting their arguments and forming networks.;N
In an increasingly aggressive environment and a battle for undecided voters in the middle, cosmopolitan forces, often seen as the winners of globalisation, promote the unconditional overcoming of the nation state with its traditional ties.;N
Two dividing failures or problems are mixed into this concern, which is in itself normatively demanding and positive in terms of human rights or climate policy: (1) the ignorance of socio-economic conditions and their impact on lifestyles which I call lifestyle arrogance and (2) the underestimation of the democratic qualities of nation states, the transferability of which to larger entities is not conceivable without problems.;N
Some dogmatic cosmopolitans thus make the mistake of using moral appeals and a certain lifestyle arrogance to defame those who, for socio-economic reasons or because of their socialisation, hold different world views [43].;N
Those who are undecided, but express doubts about the overcoming of the nation state or the radical change of their lifestyles, are portrayed as backward, nationalistic and unreasonable.;N
Lifestyles thus become even more politicised.;N
Only those who behave according to certain universal and ecological goals are considered responsible democrats.;N
From a sociological point of view, a kind banalities are politicised.;N

This cosmopolitism is relative also in the way as it does not regard the goal as an absolute dogma for which all means are justified and because it allows individuals and societies more differentiated paths to the goal.;N
It is thus a cosmopolitanism that arises from the reality of life.;N
It is rebellious because it includes resistance to every form of authoritarianism and to every kind of polarisation or division, not only on a political level, but on a daily life level.;N
Dialogue is the basis of this relative, rebellious cosmopolitanism.;N
It is what Albert Camus describes as the experience of someone who develops his solidarity from the experiences of poverty in a concrete situation [12].;N
It is thus not an academic or abstract universalism of a winner of globalisation, but the human solidarity of a person who develops cosmopolitanism solidarity in the experience of everyday life challenges.;N
This turns cosmopolitanism to its humanist core.;N
It is not founded on economic or intellectual superiority, not on the experience of being a winner, but on the contrary, on the experience of existential suffering.;N
This can also be called cosmopolitanism from below or rooted cosmopolitanism [2, 4].;N
The crucial point is the one that Patrick Hayden emphasises with recourse to Camus: A cosmopolitanism that is not dogmatic, that does not itself become an ideology [28].;N
Michael F.;N
Mascolo describes it from a psychological perspective and suggests a relational-dialectical approach for constructive political discourse.;N
This approach builds bridges through dialectical engagement [37].;N
The inclusion and understanding of the other plays a central role in this.;N
The characteristics of polarisation are mitigated by these strategies.;N
Political opponents are not considered enemies.;N
Instead of tugging at the undecided, different increased.;N

Especially at the local level, it is possible to improve the dialogue between the different population groups and their different interests [14].;N
In this scenario, already existing structures are expanded, promoted and funded by national and supranational authorities.;N
This leads to people having experiences of democracy in their immediate environment that they would otherwise not have known.;N
Bridge builders are strengthened in their work.;N
Social workers ensure that their clients are empowered in their democratic competences.;N
In this way, sections of the population that are most exposed to the risks of globalisation can bring their interests to bear, and it does not stop at articulation, but also leads to visible consequences.;N
This takes the wind out of the pushers’ sails.;N
Although they remain an important factor in the democratic game, they can no longer have the impact they had in scenario 1.;N
The bridge builders, on the other hand, become stronger and more, motivated and encouraged by state institutions and laws that put an end to dangerous inequality.;N
Polarisation will not disappear in this scenario either, but it will be turned in a direction that is less dangerous and includes the chance of democratisation.;N
In all measures, the concept of a relative, rebellious cosmopolitanism is at the forefront, which is not dogmatic and attempts to dialectically overcome the split between communitarian and cosmopolitan positions through dialogue and inclusion.;N
Without question, this scenario is very demanding and therefore, at first glance, extremely unlikely.;N
Above all, it cannot be assumed that all the measures mentioned will take place at all political levels at the same time.;N
Nevertheless, already existing initiatives can certainly be strengthened by various actors.;N

Among drug policy experts, it has become less and less contested that the War on Drugs has historically been closely entangled with structural racism [21, 66].;N
In 1970, the Nixon administration’s Controlled Substances Act (CSA) established five schedules and placed psychedelics with a whole host of other drugs into the strictest category (Schedule I), which ascribes them a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use, and lack of accepted safety even when used under medical supervision.;N
One year later, the United Nations’ Convention on Psychotropic Substances followed and banned the sale, possession, and transport of a broad range of drugs, including psychedelics.;N
As a consequence, the production, distribution, and consumption of psychedelics moved underground, and psychedelic research came to an almost complete halt in the mid-1970s due to a set of complex changes in the regulation of pharmaceutical research in the aftermath of the Thalidomide scandal, the failure of clinical trials to deliver convincing results, and funding and regulatory obstacles tied to research with Schedule I substances [35, 62].;N
This situation has pivoted slowly but steadily since around the turn of the millennium, when—despite ongoing regulatory hurdles (for suggestions on how to reduce these hurdles see [57])—research groups restarted to investigate the neurobiological effects of psychedelics as well as their clinical safety and efficacy profile for the treatment of mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, addiction, or end-of-life anxiety.;N
Together with growing positive media coverage, these efforts have mounted into a veritable psychedelic renaissance or revival [30, 70] that is well on its way to eclipse the scientific research conducted with psychedelics in the previous century at treated as medicines hithe a long tradition of use i the world, in healing, reli ing, and warfare [17, 26] such as the Amazonian p referred to as “plant me Western neo-shamanic p and appropriating South as African plants and pra ual repertoire [5, 50].;N

On the other hand, and stabilize existing socia uing non-scientific ways o Schwarz‑Plaschg E﻿ uropean Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:10 salient for the psychedelic research revival.;N
First, biomedicalization is characterized by a privatization of research and a commodification of research results as proprietary knowledge.;N
Although the psychedelic research revival started out as a mainly philanthropic endeavor due to non-existent public funding, it has become increasingly populated by start-ups and private investors who regard it as a promising new biotechnology market.;N
Second, biomedicine has a history of co-opting competing knowledge systems and alternative healthcare ideologies originating in social movements.;N
Since the use of psychedelics as medicines is rooted to a large extent within non-Western knowledge systems and the experiential anecdotal evidence produced in Western underground practices, biomedicalized psychedelic research can be understood as co-opting Indigenous and underground knowledge by translating them into the biomedical model without adequate reciprocity.;N
Against this background, it is essential to not just critically scrutinize psychedelic biomedical developments but to additionally look beyond biomedicalization to alternative approaches that seek to make a post-prohibitionist future present by envisioning and building legal psychedelic worlds—I speak of worlds here because these world-building activities might not a priori share the same worldviews and visions.;N
Since 2019, grassroots movements that seek to decriminalize the cultivation, possession, use, and gifting of psychedelic plants and fungi among adults as well as to legalize psilocybin mushrooms in specific treatment centers outside the biomedical framework have been spreading in US cities and states.;N
In addition, exemptions for the religious use of psychedelics have been granted to several churches by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the past decades.;N
The US case thus shows how a Western country Technology, and Society ( ingly turned its gaze towa to shape sociotechnical in future is no longer under pated but as a site for po stakeholders [1, 2, 9].;N

It ends with a note on how the existence of socio-psychedelic imaginaries exemplifies a paradigm that does not restrict imagination to the human.;N
 Imagining and tracing socio‑psychedelic imaginaries The concept of imaginaries lends itself to analyze how post-prohibitionist psychedelic futures are imagined and enacted in the present because it denotes a faculty of collectives as well as specific future-oriented visions and actions.;N
The term originated in the writings of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan [52] and later gained traction among philosophers and social theorists such as Arjun Appadurai [4], Cornelius Castoriadis [11], and Charles Taylor [73].;N
This article builds mainly on the work of philosopher-psychoanalyst Cornelius Castoriadis, who, in his 1975 book The Imaginary Institution of Society (1997), conceptualizes the instituting social imaginary as a radical creative power.;N
The social imaginary refers to the fundamental assumptions that appear as real and unquestionable for a specific society or subculture.;N
Instituting social imaginaries can over time crystallize into instituted social imaginaries, which guarantee “a society’s continuity, the reproduction and repetition of the same forms, which thenceforth rule men’s [sic!] lives and remain there so long as a slow historical change or a massive new creation doesn’t come to modify or radically replace them with other ones” ([12], p.;N
73f.).;N
This points to the tension-filled dynamic between instituted imaginaries and radical novelty-generating instituting imaginaries.;N
By moving beyond reproduction and pre-existing forms, radical imaginaries exceed simple explanations based on historical conditions, thereby fostering hope for unexpected social change.;N
In the case of psychedelics, strives for autonomy and imagination and the will t tional framework of the i and creative imaginary during its conception in infused by the spirit of the ments of the psychedelic and naïve half a century la has been largely replaced b capitalist imaginary, and particularly cunning in sw nary [8] and other radic [25].;N

It is therefore incapable of capturing the multiplicity of imaginaries in the psychedelic space.;N
To integrate Castoriadis and move beyond Jasanoff, I have coined the concept of socio-psychedelic imaginaries.;N
Socio-psychedelic imaginaries represent collective visions articulated and enacted to reintegrate psychedelics legally and responsibly into society in order to transform the current prohibitionist reality that keeps psychedelics out of society (similar to how certain nation states try to keep specific emerging technologies out, see [23]).;N
Socio-psychedelic imaginaries are intertwined with distinctive values and norms, views of the world and its social relations, and ideas of social change.;N
They aim to institute new societal discourses, practices, and structures to accommodate for a diversity of relationships between humans and psychedelic substances/plants/ fungi that can range from radically new to traditional to (mostly) anything in between.;N
The term socio-psychedelic stresses that psychedelics and the forms of sociality in which they are embedded cannot be separated.;N
In this way, we avoid replicating the still hegemonic prohibitionist imaginary of the War on Drugs that disentangles drugs from their users to persecute user groups on the pretense of keeping “bad drugs” out of society.;N
Adding “socio” to psychedelic also more generally serves to highlight that such imaginaries are held collectively and always enact visions of societal futures that reach far beyond the substances as such.;N
The analysis presented in this article is geared towards excavating and documenting the rupturing processes within the contemporary socio-psychedelic imagination as it seeks to supersede the prohibitionist imaginary, which leads me to identify four distinct sociopsychedelic imaginaries that sometimes overlap but also diverge in their politics of sociopolitical transformation.;N
Methodologically, I have studied contemporary socio- psychedelic events that decriminalization, legaliz analysis of (3) 35 existing p (4) around 250 media art newspapers, magazines, a selected social media di and Facebook, by followin tions.;N

In any case, access to psychedelics will be restricted to patients with diagnosed mental health disorders within this imaginary, even if the substances are used off-label for other mental health conditions than those for which they were originally tested.;N
The medical system serves therefore as a powerful gatekeeper deciding who will get which treatment when at what cost.;N
In order to mobilize for the biomedicalization imaginary among stakeholders and publics, researchers and biomedicalization advocates tend to mention the large number of people suffering from mental health issues in their publications and conference presentations, in short, what is labeled the “mental health crisis.” For instance, George Goldsmith, co-founder of COMPASS Pathways, a company developing psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, has in the context of one of his public presentations stated that he learned this strategy of measuring and demonstrating urgency from cancer researchers.;N
I have witnessed at several occasions that advocates of this imaginary have asked the audience at their talks to close their eyes and raise their hand if they or someone in their family ever suffered from a mental health issue.;N
This usually amounts to an audience full of raised hands, visually evidencing in situ the epidemic proportions of the “mental health crisis.” In tandem with the mobilization of statistics [64], this visual effect works powerfully to show the indisputable societal need for PAT.;N
While solutions to alleviate mental suffering definitely are needed, the way in which such prestidigitation is employed and the “mental health crisis” is conjured up almost magically sidelines economic, political, and other to tackle the narrow goal of aiming for more sub such as changing the US coverage is the lynchpin o tion imaginary constructs available within the biom allow for insurance covera insured, which is not a giv vious example, a broader s not on the agenda at the m In order to produce epis ages, regulatory agencies data.;N

They also bring a whole host of ethical issues into view and question whether biomedicalized psychedelic experiences will really be as effective and safe as the biomedicalization advocates claim.;N
Spravato, Johnson & Johnson’s licensed esketamine nasal spray, and off-label uses of ketamine for the treatment of depression could serve as precursors for the broader biomedicalization imaginary to estimate if and how such biomedicalized psychedelic approaches actually might be able to fulfill their promise [60].;N
My exploratory interviews with clients of ketamine clinics indicate that therapeutic effects of ketamine treatments were not longlasting without psychotherapy, and in some cases even with psychotherapeutic support.;N
Finally, the legal use of psychedelics as investigational medications for patients with terminal conditions under right-to-try laws that are currently pushed in particular for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy could also be subsumed within the biomedicalization imaginary (for a mapping of research possibilities for PAT in end-of-life care see [7]).;N
 Decriminalization imaginary: partaking of “the people’s medicines” without prosecution A second socio-psychedelic imaginary burst into public awareness in 2019: the decriminalization imaginary.;N
Drug decriminalization can range from reducing criminalization (e.g., from a prison sentence to a misdemeanor) to full decriminalization, i.e., the complete removal of criminal sentences and legal prosecution.;N
The driving force behind the contemporary socio-psychedelic decriminalization imaginary is the vision to create a world in which the personal growing, possessing, using, and sharing of naturally occurring psychedelics (and to some extent also synthetic psychedelics) is no longer a criminal offense or has become the lowest law enforcement priority, the of all naturally occurring success of the Decriminali has since spread to count ruary 2022, decriminaliz passed resolutions in ten Arcata, Ann Arbor, Det Washington DC, Somervi ton.;N

“Entheogen” wa most commonly used te Schwarz‑Plaschg E﻿ uropean Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:10 that ties nature and humans in a close spiritual relationship.;N
Humans are seen as part of nature, and hence “decriminalize nature” equals “decriminalize human’s use of natural substances.” This refusal to enact the modern constitution with its separation of nature and culture [54] situates DN’s imaginary within a pre-modern tradition of entheogenic consumption practices that dates back thousands of years, a time before drug criminalization was limiting access to these plants and fungi.;N
Hence, DN activists argue that people should have the right to use what grows in nature to enact their cognitive liberty.;N
In line with the spiritual connotation of entheogen, “the sacred” is invoked as an innate, ever-present quality that is neither limited to plants nor placed in some transcendental, other-worldly realm.;N
DN’s “the sacred” much rather designates a non-modern way of seeing—a shift in/of consciousness—enabled by what could be termed entheogenic grace.;N
A second distinguishing feature of DN’s decriminalization imaginary is the way it is corroborated with both science and anecdotal evidence.;N
In their petitions and the public testimonies that are given by members of the local community at city council meetings, references to the promising results of psychedelic clinical trials are interspersed with personal accounts of how entheogenic plants and fungi have helped heal speakers or people close to them.;N
In a hearing before Oakland’s public safety committee that I attended on May 28, 2019, these personal accounts infused the atmosphere in the huge city council room with hope and enthusiasm that was positively commented on by several committee members before they raised their concerns.;N
In addition, the professional identity of the speakers was strengthened in many testimonies, signaling that they were respected members of the local community and not “random drug users.” serve people of color and o limited economic resource torically grown distrust o into view broader socioeco social justice that are lar calization imaginary.;N

Th Schwarz‑Plaschg E﻿ uropean Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:10 can be “grown in everyone’s garden like tomatoes” without prosecution.;N
Rather than promoting commercialization, they try to establish a grow-gather-gift model operating outside the capitalist system.;N
In this decriminalized setting, entheogenic plants and fungi are shared within distribution networks that are either explicitly decriminalized as in Oakland or still underground as in Santa Cruz.;N
 Legalization imaginary: experiencing psilocybin therapy in service centers outside the biomedical system A third socio-psychedelic imaginary appeared publicly in the wake of the decriminalization movement and had been in active development at least since 2015 in the state of Oregon (according to one of its main advocates): the legalization imaginary.;N
The legalization imaginary refers to visions and associated practices that aim to either fully legalize recreational use or create a regulatory framework for the manufacture, sale, and distribution of psychedelic products and services in supervised settings outside the biomedical system.;N
This section homes in on the latter and a specific version of the legalization imaginary that has already successfully materialized in the state of Oregon in the form of regulated legalization, consequently sidelining more utopian libertarian visions for complete legalization without regulation.;N
Although some of my interviewees—even central actors driving the biomedicalization imaginary—were strong proponents of implementing the full legalization of psychedelics in the long run, similar to the legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational use in many US states, such a vision is simultaneously deemed unrealistic and therefore not pursued at present.;N
The current state of the socio-psychedelic legalization imaginary needs to be clearly distin- period to regulate the lic tation, delivery, sale (but premises), and administra services.;N

In sum, Oregon’s current legalization imaginary is enacting a regulatory framework that constitutes a middle ground between biomedicalization and decriminalization.;N
It is less strictly controlled than biomedicalization as it functions outside of the FDA-regulated biomedicalpharmaceutical system but more regulated than decriminalization, since a state-governed organization functions as mediator between substance and consumer.;N
Bills building on Oregon’s Measure 109 are underway in US states such as New York, Colorado, and California.;N
 Sacramental imaginary: the church as provider of ritualized entheogenic experiences Finally, the fourth socio-psychedelic imaginary is the sacramental imaginary.;N
A sacrament generally describes something of mysterious and sacred significance, and in the Christian tradition a religious ritual or ceremony that imparts divine grace.;N
The term “sacramental imaginary” refers to collective visions and practices as to how psychedelics can be legally used as entheogenic sacraments in the ritualized context of a religious organization.;N
This legal status can be attained by establishing the right for the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment of the US Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA 1993).;N
Religious exercise with an entheogenic sacrament—most commonly a psychedelic plant (mixture) or fungus, but uses with toad venom or synthetic psychedelic substances also exist—can be protected by filing a claim or raising a defense under RFRA in court or applying for a RFRA exemption through the DEA.;N
To assert the rights granted under RFRA, a person or collective must demonstrate a sincere religious belief and that their exercise of religion has been “substantially burdened” by the federal government.;N
Once that is estab- takes place in a ceremoni strict guidelines that ofte church members [40, 51 UDV and SD, the ritualiz resembles the Catholic co the cup with the liquid church member who also participate in religious en become a member and sub In other words, the churc humans, entheogens, and for this role from state aut Recent years saw severa ing who claim Indigenou entheogenic practices.;N

In additi the Ayahuasca Manifesto their ceremonies, and th claimed ayahuasca had th referring to it as a religio denial focused significant Schwarz‑Plaschg E﻿ uropean Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:10 correlate with the appearance of mystical experiences [32, 33, 46], which are also considered to be the experiential basis of religion [47].;N
In addition to ad hoc beliefs, lack of ceremony and ritual, quantity of the controlled substance used, and the use of other controlled substances, the government also looks at evidence of commerce to demonstrate insincerity.;N
An attorney explained at a conference that evidence of commerce might even be considered the most crucial of the five measures for the assessment, because it increases the possibility that the controlled substance can be diverted away from its intended religious use.;N
This also shows that the realization of the sacramental imaginary is currently incompatible with the existing capitalist structure by legal standards, even if entheogenic churches would like to conduct their religion within a for-profit model.;N
Of all the socio-psychedelic imaginaries, the sacramental imaginary is most strongly tied to Indigenous and non-Western traditions, as proving these lineages is important to convince the DEA of sincerity of religious practices.;N
Both the UDV’s and SD’s entheogenic sacraments are shipped from South America to the US, but Soul Quest got its vine and leaves (the two plant ingredients commonly used to brew ayahuasca) from a seller in the Netherlands, who labeled the components not for human consumption, which the DEA then used to point out that the source was non-religious.;N
While the sacramental imaginary might appear as the most non-modern socio-psychedelic imaginary, entheogenic churches are also “modern” organizations that mobilize science for their purposes.;N
For instance, the UDV was successful in drawing on studies about their communities to convince the court that the government had neither sufficiently proved health risks nor that there was a substantial risk for recreational abuse.;N

Establishing accountability structures, however, carries the risk of not making the substances broadly accessible because they tend to restrict participation, which elucidates a tension between politics of access and politics of responsibility.;N
Politics of naming Since the term psychedelic is imagined to carry a stigma in some circles, the imaginaries distance themselves from the history of prohibition through a politics of naming that imbues the substances with respectability.;N
While “psychedelic” still serves as a useful umbrella term in the biomedicalization imaginary, PAT packages are always created as psychotherapeutic interventions around specific substances such as MDMA or psilocybin (studies with LSD have been avoided in the early days of the psychedelic revival due to its strongest association with the 1960s).;N
The legalization imaginary continues this strategy by focusing on the less charged substance/name of psilocybin, thereby further narrowing psychedelic exceptionalism to psilocybin exceptionalism as a side effect of this politics of naming.;N
The decriminalization imaginary and the sacramental imaginary both mobilize the more spiritual-religious connotation of the terms entheogen and sacrament, which serves as demarcation from a stigmatized psychedelic history, imputations of recreational or hedonistic drug use, and capitalist structures.;N
Politics of assimilation and social change The imaginaries differ in how far they are assimilating to existing socioeconomic structures as well as their visions and means for social change.;N
The biomedicalization imaginary is most assimilated to the contemporary capitalist political economy, trying to bring “new” drugtherapy-packages to market without tackling existing structures, but it remains avoid assimilating to the c commodification and com nalization imaginary and are farthest away from a ist structures, as the law p within them.;N

This last point brings us ecosystem of socio-psyche the imaginaries are co-ev quing, and amplifying eac imaginary has without do Schwarz‑Plaschg E﻿ uropean Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:10 effect less likely [69].;N
I have observed a tendency among psychedelic researchers to respond more favorably to Oregon’s legalization imaginary than to the decriminalization imaginary for the same reason.;N
By arguing that science should come first (see also [63]), these researchers assign a different temporal importance to decriminalization and legalization.;N
Generally, biomedicalization tends to be the official imaginary of most researchers, with other imaginaries being held more privately, which points to the relevance of setting-sensitive articulations of socio-psychedelic imaginaries.;N
These first qualitative observations call to be further explored and corroborated by sociological (survey) studies on expert populations and different publics.;N
Based on the interpretation of my findings, socio-psychedelic imaginaries could be correlated with differences in social positions and identities.;N
Who holds and endorses which socio-psychedelic imaginaries for which reasons?;N
What positionality enables actors to become the main drivers of these instituting imaginaries?;N
Of the four socio-psychedelic imaginaries, biomedicalization is the most resource-backed in both the US and Europe at the moment.;N
If PAT packages become FDAapproved, the European Medicines Agency is expected to follow suit if additional scientific data is provided (the main research organizations/companies are also running clinical trials in Europe).;N
Due to differences between healthcare systems, reimbursable PAT could actually become more likely in Europe than in the US, which could contribute to a more equitable rollout of PAT on the European continent.;N

By contrast, paradigms that solely locate imagination in human actors and institutions (for an example see e.g., [48], p.;N
17) appear imperfect for the survival of our and other species because they perpetuate an anthropocentrism that permits and perpetrates exploitation and subjugation of those entities it denies imagination.;N
The question is therefore not whether animals, plants, and fungi can imagine like humans but how they can assist humanity to imagine and enact a livable planetary future in which the War on Drugs and the War on Nature are both relics of the past.;N

Is th What lessons can be learned from the Cambridge Analytica event?;N
Will it be possible to humans?;N
What are the paths available for the future?;N
Introduction At least until 2015, the Internet and social networks enjoyed enormous popularity due to their democratizing qualities.;N
There was no question, or apparently not enough evidence to question, about a possible negative impact.;N
The most skeptical just questioned the importance of social networks without noticing negative effects1.;N
Indeed, during the so-called Arab Spring (2010– 2013), Western media and to a lesser extent political elites and academic circles (see, e.g., [5]), were quick to highlight the virtues of the Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter revolutions.;N
Young people “connected by the Internet” put an end to “despotism and corruption,” highlighted El País of Madrid2.;N
The networks, said the New York Times, up with the authorities3.” its simplicity: networks g underrepresented by the tyrannical leaders.;N
The optimistic narrativ networks were a powerful eral democracy lost steam repeating itself: homo tw manipulable as homo vid agora shared by citizens also used by tyrants and alarm bells” of the West triumph.;N
As it later turned out Arocena et al.;N
European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 available for the future?;N
Seeking to provide a rough answer to these questions, this paper critically reflects on the premises of Yuval Noah Harari [14, 15] and Manuel Castells [6, 7] on the crisis of the liberal narrative, and in particular of democracy.;N
Roughly speaking, according to the first author, while it is unlikely that in the coming decades we will face a robot rebellion, it is likely that democracy will face, increasingly more frequently, to armies of bots that, using the information we provide online, seek to sell us not only commercial products but also political products and ideologies.;N
And for Manuel Castells, liberal democracy is in an acute crisis of legitimacy because the institutions on which it was built do not have the confidence of the population, neither the states, political parties, Catholic Church, the judiciary nor the media have the necessary legitimacy among citizens, undermined in part by political corruption, media scandals and awareness of the enormous economic inequality that characterizes today’s societies.;N
If it is also true that there are some exceptions in particular countries regarding some of these institutions, which still maintain significant levels of trust, data for the past decades show an overall descending trend in the confidence and legitimacy of democracy4.;N
We must also mention that the promise of expansion of liberal democracy, together with the wave of globalization of information technologies to areas other than the “West” in the twenty-first century, has not occurred.;N
Authoritarian regimes in much of Asian and African countries have not changed with the expansion of communication technologies.;N
So much so that for this sociologist, one of the most brilliant interpreters of the information age, and an enthusiastic defender of the democratizing power of the Internet at the beginning of the millennium, “today liberal democracy has exhausted its his- must make the effort to tr and project some possible knowing that in the latte analytical purposes, it i course of human history revolutions.;N

Regardless of whe are currently at the dawn Arocena et al.;N
European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 breadth and depth of the changes: many radical changes are occurring simultaneously.;N
The interaction of various disciplines and discoveries of different kinds have ceased to be part of fiction and have become tangible realities.;N
Today, the fusion of technologies encompasses various fields and three megatrends can be highlighted: (i) physical: autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, advanced robotics, new smart materials that self-repair or clean themselves, (ii) digital: Internet of things, AI, and, (iii) biological: genetic manipulation and advances in the field of medicine ([31]: 22–31).;N
Finally, a third characteristic is related to the profound transformation generated by the impact of these new developments.;N
Not only are we witnessing the creation of new business models and the reshaping of production, consumption, and transportation systems, but, at the societal level, a paradigm shift is occurring in the way we communicate, express ourselves, inform, entertain, and even in how our governments and various policy areas are managed.;N
Despite the relative consensus on the major current trends, there is no single narrative on how to live with these changes, let alone what will happen in the future.;N
Authors such as Bill Joy [19] and more recently Kevin Kelly [20], draw attention regarding the presence of at least a triad of narratives: utopian, dystopian, and protopian.;N
While the former argue that technological progress—artificial intelligence, gene editing and nanotechnologies—will bring with it the possibility of transcending the natural evolution of the human species through the mastery of artificial selection creating “super humans,” the latter assert that the possibility of an unprecedented accumulation of power in the hands of isolated individuals or restricted groups with easy access to knowledge and materials and self-reproducing power of new technologies, poses a greater threat than The boundary between the the Gordian knot of democ Democracy is one of the interest among scholars humanities.;N
Without the sis, it is possible to identif redefining this concept.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 Some of the most prominent scholars of political science have done battle in this area.;N
Norberto Bobbio [2] called attention to the false promises of democracy, highlighting structural inadequacies in matters of participation, representation, power and transparency.;N
Giovanni Sartori [28], for his part, made a distinction between real democracies, as they exist in reality, and ideal democracies, i.e., as we would like them to be.;N
Even more radically, Robert Dahl [9] argued that democracy is not possible, coining the term polyarchy.;N
More recently, in What to Expect from Democracy.;N
Limits and possibilities of self-government, Adam Przeworski [25] attempted to free real democracies from the false expectations of the ideal of self-government.;N
According to the author, representative democracy has failed to solve, and probably will not solve, four challenges that, even today, continue to provoke widespread dissatisfaction.;N
Przeworski begins his analysis by exploring the controversial terrain of equality.;N
According to him, one of the most incisive criticisms of democracy is based on its inability to generate socioeconomic equality and, as a result, to forge a social situation where political equality coexists with social and economic inequality.;N
According to the author, in modern societies, where land is no longer the most important source of income, it is difficult to equalize productive assets.;N
Even if it were possible to equalize income-earning capacity, inequality would resurface in a market economy.;N
“We cannot expect democracy to do what perhaps no system of political institutions can do,” (2010:50).;N
Another issue that continues to plague modern democracies is the nostalgia for effective participation.;N
As Przeworski explains, although in representative democracies voters have real choices, they will never choose among all conceivable possibili- unavoidable.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 common myths that exist only in the collective imagination: from the gods in antiquity, to the modern ideal of democracy.;N
For at least three centuries, Harari asserts in Homo Deus (2015), our Western societies have been organized under a narrative in which human experience is the supreme source of authority: humanism.;N
Over time, the evolution of this narrative splintered into three main branches: liberal humanism (democracy, human rights and free market capitalist-socialist), socialist humanism (including communism), and evolutionary humanism (including fascism).;N
The victory of the Allies during the Second World War put an end to fascism and with it to evolutionary humanism, while the victory of the West during the Cold War put an end to socialist humanism.;N
Since then, democracy, human rights and free market capitalism seemed destined to endure indeterminately, as Francis Fukuyama [12] put it in his famous and controversial “end of history.” However, Harari reflects, “history took an unexpected turn, and now, after the collapse of fascism and communism, liberalism is in trouble” ([15]: 14).;N
According to the author, the liberal narrative considers individual free will as the most important value.;N
While in economic matters “the customer is right,” in politics “the voter knows what he wants.” From this conception: “democracy assumes that human feelings reflect a mysterious and profound “free will,” which is the ultimate source of authority, and while some people are more intelligent than others, all humans are equally free.;N
Like Einstein and Dawkins, an illiterate servant girl also has free will, so that on election day her feelings (represented by her vote) count as much as anyone else’s ([15]: 66–7).” This assumption would currently be the Achilles’ heel of liberal democracy.;N
“Once someone [...] has the technological ability to access and manipulate the human the capacity of abstraction apathetic and manipulabl concentrated his efforts o evision, he reflected on th time of his analysis, was ory, he asserted, “the Inte growth.;N
But in practice th the homo videns is already the network” (1998: 55)5.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 But how do these trends affect democracy?;N
According to the thesis underpinning this paper, there are, in principle, two risks: (a) loss of freedom vis-à-vis algorithms: listen to the algorithm and (b) loss of equality vis-à-vis data: those who own the data own the future [14, 15].;N
In one of her most recent works, Cathy O’Neil [23] investigated the impact of big data on democracy.;N
Analyzing studies conducted by the technology companies themselves, she argues that despite the lack of evidence that Facebook, Google, or Amazon are using their AI to cause harm, the potential for abuse is enormous.;N
Generally, the author asserts, companies are focused on making money.;N
However, she warns, their profits are closely tied to government policies, e.g., tax regulations.;N
By trivializing the power of these companies, O’Neil asserts, we lose sight of two relevant issues.;N
On the one hand, algorithms are not neutral.;N
Companies determine, according to their own interests, what we see and learn on their social networks or search engines.;N
On the other hand, their potential comes not only from their reach but also from their ability to influence their own customers and to use their own customers to influence their friends.;N
By way of example, the author cites two recent social experiments.;N
The first was conducted by Facebook in 2012 and involved 680,000 users with the aim of determining whether updates in their news feed could affect their mood.8 Using linguistic software, Facebook categorized positive and negative updates and then exposed users to them.;N
By evaluating subsequent behavior, they found evidence that proved their hypothesis about changes in mood states: those who were exposed to negative updates produced more negative content and vice versa.;N
Their conclusion: “Emotional states can be transferred..., leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness” ([23]: 156- 7).;N
In a similar vein, another others concerning represe the Cambridge Analytica networks are in the eye armies of bots, trolls and f dubious democratic reput ence and the generation o (responsible for the increa ance), are some of the visi network.;N
The current crisis of rep racy has not only affected locutor perceived as an all discredited, as is the case of the theses supported b that the “Internet revolut be an inexhaustible sourc participation and informa voters themselves would b who felt unrepresented o governments and their me ever, the thesis suffers from the one hand, the fact th generate news exposed the ate harmful content for di other hand, the fact of gen not guarantee users their panies began to develop tion on our behalf.;N
Finally the network does not guar interests, whether corpora One additional way between technology di through the dimension of lion.;N
In a recent press co of the book Rebuilding Eu Arocena et al.;N
European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 of opposition to authoritarian agendas provide hope for the survival of democracy, at least in Europe, the region he analyzes.;N
But, as we have seen, Europe is still the region with the best democratic performance in present.;N
Some significant parallels can be drawn between these European contexts and what is occurring in several Latin American countries.;N
If we can see a dramatic non democratic populism in Jair Bolsonaro, the elected president of Brazil, or in Ortega’s corrupt Nicaragua, or in Maduro’s flawed revolutionary Venezuela, at the same time it is also relevant to highlight the other side of the coin.;N
An unprecedent mobilization of students in Chile against the cost and privatization of education, street mobilizations and a final push to win the vote towards a new Constitutional Assembly, which was elected with gender parity and where the majority elected members do not come from the traditional political parties, but from the indigenous movement, or alternative social organizations, in the same vein the protests of Equatorian indigenous movements have the power to block antipopular measures from President Lasso, and in Bolivia the far right authoritarian movement that put off power Evo Morales, now has been defeated by the same forces that supported Morales, mainly the indigenous population, which is at least half of the Bolivians.;N
Young’s counterbalance between populist authoritarianisms that misuse information networks and private data of citizens and the quick and more spontaneous ways of protest of alternative social movements and organizations, leads us to the idea of democracy as rebellion.;N
In a recent article, “Democracy needs rebellion,” Markus Pausch [24], the author, brings into consideration the relevance and importance of resistance and rebellion for maintaining the spirit of democracy.;N
Analyzing the convictions can also be m topic of this article “Geoff importance of revolt again lance and other forms of a Of course, beside the f there must be some cons rejection of the unjust and minds are hacked, this is subordinates get in tune theory, this is the case, a Fanon in Black Skin, Wh internalize the need of c colonizers.;N

In short, as we have trie affected in several ways.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 world through technological acceleration and the data economy.;N
This technological adventure is driven by a very particular group of young university graduates, with long and flexible working hours and a level of comfort unthinkable for their parents’ generations.;N
Motivated by the promise of improving their quality of life, of rapid social promotion and recognition, these young people have managed to modify the logic of how capitalism works today, driving the massive collection of data.;N
As if it were a nostalgia for the past, this has been given the name of data mining, but today with personal information, yours, mine, everybody’s.;N
And something else, the place where all this took place in its beginning was nicknamed as the valley of silicon, the essential mineral to produce microprocessors and other computer components (Sadin, 2016: 27).;N
This ethos has transcended North American borders and has been installed as a new paradigm of economic production, social organization and political domination.;N
Increasingly common is the replacement of workers in factories by robots operated by computers with artificial intelligence, much more effective and less “problematic.” Visually this can be seen in the new intelligent technological cities, or technopolis, such as Highway 128 in Boston, Akademgorodok in Russia, or Tsukuba in Japan.11 Moreover, politics has entered an algorithmic phase in which a large part of voters are seduced by messages tailored to their needs by technological systems that know them better than they know themselves.;N
Behind these innovations lies a vision of the world that can be synthesized as technoliberalism.;N
Technoliberalism is the predominant philosophy of Silicon Valley that assimilates an updated strand of the economic liberalism of the classics along with a new faith in the liberating potential of technology.;N
“Technoliber- we could do, but we can’t (Sadin 2018: 127).;N

To avoid any negative record on your personal credit follow the rules and comply with the orders on the train and station” (audio on a 2018 Shanghai train, El Mundo, 31 October 2018).;N
Although the polysemy of democracy is high, it can be condensed as a certain political regime that empowers citizens because they have the rights to choose their representatives and be elected, in a social context of freedoms, with relatively autonomous individuals who believe they know or feel what they think is best, with political parties competing for their vote.;N
For a democracy to function more or less well there must be, first of all, as Max Weber pointed out, a belief in the legitimacy of the institutional framework that guarantees it.;N
Without this belief it is not possible to sustain it.;N
This is one of the main challenges for democracy in the context of silicolonization.;N
It is precisely because people have stopped believing in the institutions that cemented these political regimes in the last century.;N
Political parties do not have credibility, parliaments do not deserve the trust of voters, and candidates are perceived as self-interested individuals.;N
This can easily be seen in many of the opinion polls conducted in recent years in almost all parts of the world where such polls are conducted without censorship.;N
The institutions that forged democracy as the bestknown political regime no longer enjoy the confidence of the people.;N
Or, to put it another way, the citizenry has bracketed the belief in their legitimacy [7].;N
The avalanche of information and misinformation circulating in social that after a search for a p to receive recommendatio their family type?;N
This is from politics to love, from gion to housing or health.;N
Therein lies the temptat who have colonized us fro technologies believe that and much better world.;N

European Journal of Futures Research (2022) 10:3 polarization and intolerance are intensifying and crystallizing with the coming to power of leaders of dubious democratic reputation.;N
Blind trust in “technologies for liberation” and a trivialization of the negative effects of the misuse of the network and big data has led to a significant gap.;N
As various scholars have acknowledged, today’s democracies need new methodologies that allow it to armor itself against the toxic combination of these factors.;N
In particular we would like to introduce at this final stage, for further developments, the works of Sheila Jasanoff and the concept of how “sociotechnical imaginaries” relate and fabric power.;N
“Sociotechnical imaginaries occupy the blank space between two important literatures, the construction of imaginaries in political and cultural theory and of sociotechnical systems in STS” ([18]: 5)14.;N
We tend to believe that democracies die spectacularly, at the hands of armed men, the problem is that democracy can die at the hands of elected leaders who hide behind the network.;N
Perhaps, as Kofi A.;N
Annan recently asserted, the key is that if technology does not stand still, neither should democracy.;N
It reinvents itself or it is destined to perish.;N
