 OVERVIEW In this chapter we present the aim of this report.;N
 Introduction OVERVIEW 1.;N
INTRODUCTION Work has changed and it is changing, this could have been said at any time in history.;N
The very meaning of the word “work” is multiple and changed throughout time.;N
Etymologically, its origins go back to the Latin word tripalium which means a torture device [1].;N
In the Greek society, only slaves or second-class citizens used to work as it was mainly a physical activity considered undesirable by the upper-class people [2].;N
Work remained as an activity reserved for the unfortunate on the medieval ages as it was considered something terrible by the Catholic Church and the nobles [3].;N
The ethics of the religious denominations that derived from the Protestant Reformation went in direct opposition with the Catholic perspective of work by viewing it as a mean to salvation [4].;N
This change in the meaning of work was extremely important for the Industrial Revolution that was to follow for it provided the cultural and moral justification to keep people working for at least 16 hours per day.;N
The industrial revolutions deserve special consideration in the history of work as they represent “profound changes in the nd During the 2 In when electricity was production, work has a [5].;N
The characteristics o were further intensifie entrepreneurs such as the scientific administra and Ford that sough division and specializa creation of the produc electrification of prod machines substituted done by the people.;N
Fayol’s work helped to as the white-collar work The invention o Computation Technolo application on busines represent the main Industrial Revolution came new industries an the main product o became information an the economy (services the first time in history of GDP of several devel Robotics, Artificial and nanotechnology ar of the iceberg of what th 4 Industrial Revolut technologies are furthe The most likely scenario for work in 2050 presented in this report ma key points: 1.;N
Automation continues to advance in industry, in contrast to the regulations and laws on the subject, continuing projects of ins work in society.;N
 2.;N
Computerization will reduce the demand for low-skill and low-w period of unemployment, most people will train to new careers able to do so relying on the state to provide them a basic incom change to create new opportunities: some economies will redu avoiding unemployment of higher skilled people.;N
 3.;N
After a period of job insecurity and a series of disputes betwee of Employment workers and their employees, the new types of better regulated in order to provide minimum worker rights.;N
help workers in new NSEs to organize themselves in order to fi for better working conditions.;N
 4.;N
A transition to a personalized education process will be p technologies, which takes into account personal needs, interests 5.;N
This personalized education and the trend of jobs automation workload to the workers, giving them more free time to stud keeping them updated and involved in a lifelong learning.;N
 6.;N
Workers will receive knowledge-intensive training, allowing their types of jobs.;N
 7.;N
The collaboration and exchanges will increase, as well as the entrepreneurship in the global labor market.;N
 8.;N
The society will demand more transparency and participation in new technologies, although keeping the traditional struct Minorities will use these new technologies and mediums to stren for political empowerment.;N
 9.;N
The population will age and legislations will be amended s OVERVIEW bring some benefits for the society, as well as some new challenges.;N
The importance of this report relies in addressing these challenges as soon as possible in order to produce efficient results in our society.;N
We took some assumptions while performing our analysis until 2050.;N
The first one is that there will be no disruptive technological breakthrough.;N
The second one is that will be no large-scale war – although asymmetric conflicts will continue to exist.;N
Finally, the third one is that will be no global catastrophe.;N
Therefore, we pointed out the key themes that policy-makers, entrepreneurs and workers should discuss in the near future.;N
Although there is no right model to be followed, we believe that these actors should debate these topics: 1.;N
Robots and AI Regulation: should Robots and AI be limited or forbidden, highly taxed in order to support income transfer programs, or be left unregulated?;N
2.;N
Income transfer programs: should the government create income transfer programs?;N
If so, which model, Universal Basic Income, Universal Basic Assets or other?;N
3.;N
Non-Standard forms of egalitarian, participato society.;N
 PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK In this part, we analyze the key trends that drive t work.;N
 Increasing automation will impact your life PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 2.;N
INCREASING AUTOMATION WILL IMPACT YOUR LIFE Since the last century, computers have been routinely performing physical activities in industries, performing better and being cheaper than humans.;N
With new technologies, machines are getting closer to being able to make judgments and decisionmaking.;N
Formerly, such capacities were impossible for something non-human [14].;N
Today only 5% of occupations are candidates for total automation, with total loss of human tasks [14].;N
Even so, almost all professions have partial automation potential.;N
The impact of automation on workers is predictable in the production of physical products, especially in the retail and retail market.;N
Collection and data processing are also fully automatable and as we see the latest assembly line operations and archivists suffer from the same problem.;N
Some key points have to be considered when talking about adopting automation [14]: · Technical feasibility: The technique may be in the prototype phase, making it impossible to use it extensively.;N
 popular acceptanc adoption becomes The effects of auto at the macro level in t the micro level they ca increasing unemploym region or monopoly companies with automa 2.1.;N
WILL WE NEED PO ADVANCED AI AND Artificial Intelligenc for 60 years now, and o remarkable progress ha area.;N
In 2011, Watson designed by IBM, w questionnaires the cha Brad Rutter and Ken first moment in which humans in this type of c AlphaGo, one of intelligence systems, game challenge with L best professional Go p [15].;N
 The technological is in process.;N
The c memory, bandwidth, s have been falling e KEY TR reading emails, cleaning or even driving cars for us.;N
However, this will also impact our privacy, security, and ethics.;N
Many uncontrolled consequences can arise if we are unable to identify the previously related threats [15].;N
Building machines that can learn on their own is a key to this revolution, along with new regulatory policies.;N
Historically, we have an automation problem: if, for any reason, no human could explain all the steps taken in completing a task, then no programmer could incorporate those rules into software.;N
Recent advances shows that this is not a great obstacle to be overcome anymore.;N
Machines can learn even when humans cannot teach them and can learn more efficiently, since they can generate new knowledge alone and faster than humans [16].;N
Technological advances have an impact on the way work is done.;N
Such a radical reform of labor will require new policies to protect the vulnerable unprepared for the new age.;N
The choices made now will be decisive in the direction to be followed.;N
Erroneous interventions undermine the economic prospects of millions of people around the world, leaving underdeveloped nations out of the race against the automation yet, g technology and kn human behavior i intelligence [17].;N
 What we have automation will cre areas such as AI entirely new job additional wealth an This discussion for underdevelope the margin of the focus of studies in characteristics suit such cases, interve is required to ensu prepared for the ne share the potentia broadly with societ as increased inves vocational training Regarding the years the concept grown, so the num sets affect the r training.;N
Therefore applications will re data.;N
The privacy is exploiting this dat PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK intelligent transportation and logistics, smart building, environmental monitoring, medical and health care, among others.;N
[19].;N
Predictions for the number of connected devices on the Internet of Things for the year 2020 vary considerably, from Gartner 26 billion (Gartner) to 30 billion (ABI Research), to 50 billion (Cisco) to 75 billion (Morgan Stanley) [18].;N
The impact of IoT on industrial automation and control is increasingly present in society.;N
The evolution of sensor technologies that define the Internet of Things will lead to lower cost automation systems and production maximization.;N
The benefits of IoT include low-cost, highperformance processors, robust low-cost sensors, analytical software, vision systems, cloud computing, and highly distributed system architectures [20].;N
Many companies are seeking key knowledge to be applied for competitive advantage through Big Data analysis.;N
Therefore, companies that possess the skills needed to analyze and generate business intelligence from several sources of data in real time will take the lead in the market.;N
This trend follows the flow of increasingly society, in the case o smart meters that mon patients, seniors or chil Other implication issues should be ta especially in home auto of sensor data as a espionage [21].;N

Connect interaction, integrated KEY TR other hand, usually consists of readers and a large population of tags.;N
In addition, each tag has a small memory to store its unique ID and some other information, for example, product price, expiration date, personal information, and so on.;N
These labels may be managed through wireless network in real time, among other advantages over identification techniques such as magnetic stripe and bar code [23].;N
 3.;N
EMPLOYMENT WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING th The world faces the 4 Industrial Revolution which has a widespread impact on society, affecting education, employment, and skills, requiring stronger partnerships between governments, educators, training providers, workers and employers [24].;N
The main drivers of this revolution are artificial intelligence, machine learning, nanotechnology, 3D printing, robotics, biotechnology, and genetics each interacting in multiple directions and intensifying each other.;N
While new technologies are expected to promote a better society and well-being they can also represent threats to jobs and shall be proactively observed and adapted by, societies, governments, corporations, and individuals [24].;N

Even if this prediction seems more optimistic than the technological unemployment, it also has its dangers for society.;N
For the last two centuries, economists defended that the job displacement theory have been right but there is no economic law guaranteeing that most people automatically benefit from technological progress [35].;N
The occupations that are more likely to be computerized in the next decades are the ones with the lowest average median wages and the ones in which we are less likely to find people with a bachelor’s degree or better [36].;N
This trend should be a concern for society because the people that are more likely to lose their jobs are also the ones with least resources to change careers given that it requires enrolling in courses to acquire new creative and social skills [36].;N
Another trend that is likely to help to destroy some careers is the rise of the knowledge economy.;N
As the economy moves away from being dominated by the solutions that look to the work week [33].;N

 Local work will be refreshed to provide value on another sort of occupations, mainly motivated by the automation and its consequences, which will generate in the medium term the extinction of manual jobs, as well as the dangerous, dirty and risky jobs.;N
[26] [46].;N
Globalization will not overcome local work, but will promote modifications on how the work is done.;N
 3.3.;N
WILL I HAVE T LONG?;N
 Considering the flexibility of where the worker can be, as mentioned previously, centralized offices with hundreds of people that ignore the travel time of employees tends to change.;N
Distributed offices on multiple locations or even co-working spaces will promote a cost reduction to enterprises, becoming an alternative to central offices located on a fully commercial area [26].;N
Despite a global population of approximately six billion individuals, just the minority is considered part of the developed global workforce [47] [48].;N
It is estimated that 80 percent of the world’s population are at the bottom of the economic pyramid, and live predominantly In the past few increase in flexible models which fost part-time jobs and to the reformulatio the relationship b employer [25] [26].;N

This trend shall promote a significant impact on society as organizations will be able to keep on being competitive by having access to a bigger pool of skilled professionals thus reducing the shortage of specialists and the impact on social security systems [55] [25].;N
Considering the advances on Healthcare automation, increase in the use of continuous-health tracking devices, reduction of healthcare costs and human mistakes being extinguished due to automation, life expectancy and the time that an individual will be able to work and have an active participation in society will increase [56] [45].;N
 3.4.;N
HOW ABOUT MY LABOR RIGHTS?;N
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO) [57], “Non-Standard forms of Employment have become a contemporary feature of labor markets around the world”.;N
In South America, 6 out of 10 young people who get a job today do so in the informal economy [51].;N
This trend is not exclusive to countries in development, Petrie [58] predicts that 40% of the US labor force will be self-employed 3.;N

 Earnings Wages tend to be substantially lower for compared to those in standard employment.;N
 Working hours Working hours are more uncertain for work lower work-life balance.;N
 Occupational security and health Injury rates are higher among workers in NSE.;N
 Social security Social security coverage law sometimes exclu when they are covered, their employment result in worse benefits.;N
 Training Workers in NSE are less likely to receive on-the have negative repercussions on career deve young workers.;N
 Representation and other fundamental rights at work Workers in NSE may lack access to freedo collective bargaining rights either for legal reas more tenuous attachment to the workplace.;N
Th violations of their fundamental rights at work, i and forced labor.;N
 Firms Firms that rely heavily on NSE need to adapt strategies from training and development of identifying the sets of skills that the firm n market.;N
An over-reliance on NSE can lead to a specific skills in the organization, limiting its changing market demand.;N
 Labor markets and society Widespread use of NSE may reinforce labor leading to a greater volatility in employment economic stability.;N
 PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK harder for workers on the new NSE to organize and to form unions.;N
Crowdworkers, for instance, are facing a challenging goal due to their geographical distribution that makes it harder to create solidarity between the workers in this particular category [60].;N
On the other side, the very spread and growth of some companies in the gig economy could make it easier for worker’s organizations to aim at them ( i.e.;N
by increasing vertical integration in some traditionally highly fragmented sectors such as car-hailing services) [62].;N
The labor movement survived recent changes in economy in two ways, and maybe these practices can be used in the future.;N
The first one involves using the same technology that is partly responsible for the creation of some of the new NSE and for the intensification of globalization to help workers organize.;N
This is already being done as shown by the following examples.;N
1 App-Based Drivers Association (ABDA) is a group from Seattle (United States) that aims to give a voice to app-based (e.g.;N
Uber, Lyft) drivers.;N
This association allows new members to join it by filling an online form on their website.;N
This group had a major win in 2015 when a law was passed by the city of Seattle allowing the car-haling app drivers to form unions [60] [62].;N
 from traditional union actors.;N
Unions can see demand economy as a members [60].;N

With a role in educat knowledge-based w possibility is to development of int genetics, viruses [65 UPDATED With the big changes coming to work, education will need to adapt using advancements in technology to achieve this change.;N
As work becomes more and more demanding of the skilled workforce with a deep knowledge of their skills, the education system will need to train new, more specialized workers, with some forms of work ceasing to exist and new jobs emerging [44].;N
Changes in education are usually reactive: there is a tendency to continue the process of training workers to (soon-to-be) old jobs in order to serve current job market, creating a gap for the new ones.;N
The world will need to adapt to a new way of teaching so that people’s competences are not outdated and lose job opportunities [44].;N
This is a major change in how we feel about work today, when an individual study during his youth and then chooses a career that tends to be kept the same during the life.;N
In the future, we will have to keep on learning throughout life to adapt to different jobs.;N
As it can be seen, the social 4.1.;N
DO WE NEED N The increasing transforming ind models, changing t need and reduci employees’ skill se people will have different skills to s PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK requires an investment in education of years.;N
The future worker will need a different set of skills when compared to the present ones: they need more cognitive skills, such as critical thinking and non-routine problem solving, interpersonal skills, such as presentation skills and conflict resolution, and intrapersonal skills, such as adaptability and self-development [70].;N
Jobs intensive in social and creative skills have a low risk of automation [67].;N
Thus, six important skills that students can develop are: collaboration, knowledge construction, skilled communication, self-regulation, realworld problem-solving, and use of information and communication technology for learning [71].;N
The rise in the demand of highly skilled workers tends to occur simultaneously to the rise in the demand of lower level jobs, especially in services – jobs requiring low or no skills are projected to grow [69].;N
Literacy and numeracy are fundamental skills [72], and team working and communication are important skills for most jobs [69].;N

 4.3.;N
WILL SELF-EMPLOYMENT SAVE THE WORLD ?;N
The labor market has a significant presence of self-employed workers – small traders, doctors, basic manufacturers, lawyers, freelance handymen, smallholder farmers.;N
Self-employment is not only a solution for individuals who have not found such as Airbnb.;N
We trends – i.e., the depends on the e scenario of econom unemployment, the complements the w However, in a sc economic or labo collaborative econo possible option for As an agent to PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK However, it does not reduce the importance of traditional self-employment governmental programs that provide business training, technical support, and financial assistance, giving to freelancer workers a better understanding of all aspects of starting and operating a new business [84].;N
This training is an effective program for assisting unemployed workers interested in self-employment to start their own business, remain self-employed, and avoid unemployment for long periods [84].;N
 4.4.;N
WILL EVERYONE RECEIVE ADVANCED EDUCATION AND TRAINING?;N
As a part of these new, big changes, workers in the future will shift from having generalist ability to having specialist ability [44], at the higher levels of knowledge or at lower ones.;N
As technology advances, educated workers tend to benefit more and those less educated tend to have their jobs automated first [70].;N
For instance, the manufacturing industry went from craftsmanship to the factory system, changing dynamically from mechanized powered systems to the present-day trend towards application of advanced manufacturing technology (computerized design, planning, and manufacturing tools such as CAD, CAM and MRP).;N

Servitization, Informatization, Digitalization, and Creativization will be new digital services [92].;N
Public services that provide social welfare as services for digital cities will be based on jointly resource-conscious, facilitating innovation and creativity, functioning as a service economy [93].;N
In fact, this transition from traditional models to more transparent and agile models is a symptom that covers many areas from software development to service exchanges and micro-pay according to the time you spend running a given demand.;N
In addition, the idea of creative cities is also related to an agenda and progressive planning including aspects of sustainability and social inclusion [94].;N
New productive arrangements have been tested, mainly due to the relationship functioning of lar and showing a new where creativity, c and agility are fund In the other moving to become Such organizations cultivate and trans to modify people a on the motivation insights and brains engagement [95].;N

Elderly population, as a percentage of total populati people's productive age will get larger, causing an increase in the economically active population.;N
Thus, longer lives imply changes in pension systems, as well as workers going beyond the normal retirement age for better pension.;N
The delayed retirement is a phenomenon in which elderly population keeps their labor force participation.;N
This is a recent phenomenon and is more noticeable in high-income workers and in less physically demanding occupations.;N
Workers whom delay the retirement also may delay claiming Social Security benefits [97].;N
In general, rules for eligibility to retire and claiming a pension benefit are complex and vary according to each government Bosworth et al.;N

In summary, if the trend in increase of gender equality sustains itself over the next decades, a reduction in the rate of increase of economic inequality can be expected [100].;N
Gender equality itself has been improving over the last decades but there is still a lot to be done for women rights in several countries with some critical cases as some countries in North Africa and Middle East.;N

Thinking of forms of regimes, implemented by nations, UBI would play out differently in each of these regimes, and in relation to the diverse set of existing policies in each [107].;N
In the other hand, the Institute for the 10 Future understands that Universal Basic Assets (UBA) is a fairer way of challenging inequality.;N
The UBA is a core set of resources that everyone should have, including housing, education, healthcare and financial security and has been proposed as a way to avoid economic disasters by properly assessing and distributing our resources to meet the needs of each person.;N
It can be seen as an evolution of the UBI concept, which gives each citizen a fixed amount of guaranteed Following the d a phenomenon call is predicted by so This phenomenon Gross Domestic developed countrie Today, we already activity shifting from means that dev increasing at a larg capital and people [ Countries like Indonesia and Me their GDP an ave percent per yea Indonesia are like larger in terms of PART 1: KEY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK Figure 6.;N

Also, while some countries are rapidly growing, some of them are not growing at all, increasing the gap between developed and underdeveloped countries [116].;N
Inequality has significant implications on the macroeconomic stability on 2050 as it tends to concentrate the power in the hands of the few.;N
Inequality can lead to suboptimal use of human resources, cause investment reduction, and political and economic instability [116].;N

Developing countries can find an opportunity to lead the creation of new IPs while exploiting technologies and challenges that developed countries and avoiding to commit the same mistakes of the developed countries [119].;N
The growing number of IPs in the developing countries can cause some harm too.;N
The great number of new patents and IPs can cause a scenario of choking and blocking of the technology creation [119].;N
This phenomenon, caused by low standard IPs, can be avoided by the creation of new, and more rigid standards for registering a new patent, and causing an over-protection of the IPs a country currently holds [119].;N

WILL AUTOMATION DESTROY OR ENHANCE THE E CONOMY ?;N
Technology alone will not determine economic results in terms of growth, inequality, or employment.;N
All leading economies have had access to similar levels of technology, but have had very different outcomes throughout history because they have had different institutions and policies [121].;N
Although today less than 5% of the occupations can be fully automated [14], the increasing automation will affect almost all occupations, not only factory workers and employees, but also landscaping gardeners and dental laboratory technicians, stylists, insurance sales representatives and CEOs to a greater or lesser extent.;N
Technological progress is the main driver of per capita GDP growth, allowing output to rise faster than labor and capital.;N
Increases in labor productivity generally translate into increases in average wages, giving workers the opportunity to reduce working hours and offer more goods and services [121].;N

The Academy can invest in new ways of learning and the government may create regulation for the society and markets [99].;N
Basic income is a policy that may be created by a government in order to decrease inequality – minimum wage is a common example of this type of social policy.;N
This subject is much debated among specialists in the area and is also controversial.;N
In a very short and reduced explanation, some of them, more liberal, consider that basic income and minimum wages can cause a disequilibrium in the labor market [125].;N
One of the consequences is inflation.;N
In the other point of view, minimum wages and basic income are an important public policy to reduce wage inequality and to have more equality between people.;N
Some studies consider that basic income and minimum wages can accelerate the market through stimulated aggregate demand [126].;N
 PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2 In this part, we develop three scenarios for the the optimistic, which considers the best outcome f the pessimist, which considers the worst, and the considers the trends we judged most probable.;N
 Optimistic Scenario PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 7.;N
OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO In this scenario, we present an optimistic foresight in how working will be in the year of 2050.;N
Using the trending changes identified in the Key Trends of the Future, we present our view for the next years if the best of the changes come to be.;N
 7.1.;N
AUTOMATION In this scenario we will not reach the singularity – a point where AI triggers an intelligence explosion, but on the other hand, we will absorb a strong impact on the way of processing data and information more quickly influenced by quantum computation.;N
Artificial Intelligence will be controlled by global and democratic regulations among nations to prevent their undue use as the domination of humankind by machines.;N
Artificial Intelligence will provide a scenario in 2050 of profound changes in work, replacing humans with robots and software in various areas, especially in tasks that do not use critical thinking and the accumulation of knowledge acquired by human learning experiences.;N
In this way, humans will adapt to a new reality of man-machine synergy in the More jobs opportuniti increase, which induce and investment.;N
Finally induces the production more jobs, in a virtuous With companies b more money from th workers, they can theo benefits for those work lower the prices, thes more goods with the money.;N
 Automation does human work obsolete, it, by replacing parts o we will have plausible m people deciding betwe will be ranked ac automation potential.;N
 7.2.;N
EMPLOYMENT In this scenario, bo companies will recogni workers that will lose automation and will f predictively.;N
This will a the benefits of au reduction of the co elimination of repetitive A VIEW OF keep informed of the trends in employment and use the same technology that disrupt work for their benefit.;N
Globalization will reach its most beneficial potential with workers dispersed around the world collaborating via computational tools such as augmented and virtual reality.;N
This computer-mediated work will allow people to do more homework bringing workers closer to their families and neighborhood lives and, more importantly for the globalization impact, they will not need to leave their home countries in order to find work.;N
 7.3.;N
EDUCATION education will gro STEM jobs will be future world.;N
The integration would only by grafting it o but by changing its the adaptation of th into new ones, that As this new e structured, there regularization or in However, as we ma education we still n assert that the hi remains.;N
 7.4.;N
SOCIAL WELFA We can see as a consequence of the trending changes and advancements of education, learning will be mostly selftaught, there will be easy and fast access to high quality education, alas the education will be even more specialized and knowledge-intensive generating a deep improvement in the workforce that will be more qualified.;N
With the increasing personalization of education and its importance to the new jobs needs, self-taught provides a higher adaptability to the worker.;N
Rather than In this scenario retire early and th people to spend o in their free time.;N
 Natural and preserved and exp technology, par broadens and all protected, reducing Universal Basic implemented.;N
Cou cheaper and susta PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 countries on G20 grow their GDP at an average rate of three to four percent a year and the top economies of the world change.;N
Countries like Brazil, Indonesia, India and Mexico closes their technology gap with the developed countries, increasing their GDP and creating a favorable environment for new business opportunities, allowing their population to engage on the new opportunities.;N
All this advancement in technology is extremely important for workers, as it helps them to develop and update their knowledge and skills.;N
In a world where everyone will have access to the internet, the ability to learn new things from open and free learning platforms will reduce the unemployment impact, because people will acquire new skills, mitigating the technology unemployment.;N
Thus, these technological advances will slow down the growth in inequality, the creation of new jobs and people having more free time to spend with family and to have fun.;N
In 2050, the rapid growth of the global population also starts to decrease and the population stabilizes around ten billion people.;N
With the increased population number, more cities start to appear.;N
People start to migrate from larger cities to smaller 8.1.;N
AUTOMATION In this scenario advance quicker th becoming increasingly a high unemployment see the benefits of chan workers for more pr Public policies to help this scenario will not b big portion of society ou The owners of algorithms that ca unemployment will “ow their products to the work.;N
 Therefore, new te IoT will not fulfill it because of the lack of d its costs.;N
Governments fail to realize such tec for the improvement industrial applications o of cities by the use o instance.;N
 8.2.;N
EMPLOYMENT In this scenario, technological unemploy A VIEW OF higher than in present with the increase of poverty.;N
As wars continue to be waged – mainly on the Middle East – and climate change makes few coastal regions uninhabitable.;N
Thus, immigration is expected to increase causing impacts in the places that receive these fluxes such as higher unemployment rates and lower average wages.;N
Furthermore, the intensification of the globalization of the workforce will increase immigration from poorer countries to richer ones.;N
In this scenario, the loss of jobs to foreign workers will be made easier by advances in IT, which will allow companies to hire workers from wherever they cost less.;N
Companies will not reduce working hours making some women feel that working conflicts with their interest of having children and the elderly are unable to find jobs because they need more time than young workers to take care of their health, spend time with the family and rest.;N
The reluctance of changing working hours creates a phenomenon where a small group of people works 8 or more hours while a great number of people do not have themselves despite Being harder to f conditions will mak a downward spira labor rights.;N

Most w PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 population will not receive the equal access for education and training because this advance will not achieve everybody.;N
Some people will be to continue receiving a bad education either training or none of training to adapt for change jobs rapidly.;N
Open Access initiatives will fail due its high costs, increasing the number of people unprepared for to work.;N
Besides, MOOCs will be unsuccessful for part of population because for accept this kind of platform the technology must be integrated with people and Government needs to interfere.;N
Only part of the population with a minimum technology are going to receive this accept and they will occupy the jobs, concentrating the labor with them.;N
The MOOCs such other forms to learn will not be regulated from Government, decreasing the quality of the service.;N
This unfair access to information will hamper the knowledge acquisition process and reinforce the unpreparedness for most people.;N
The knowledge-intensive jobs will be rare expensive because of this inducing the significantly difference between demand and offer.;N
This cost raise will difficult the entrance of new competitors – reinforcing the existing elite.;N

Other minorities, such afrodescendants, and immigrants, will suffer as alt-right, and supremacist movements get more support.;N
In this wave of conservative thought, LGBTI community will also see almost no advancement of their rights – and possibly some regress.;N
As countries face rising inequality, nationalist groups will increase in power and, as seen previously in history, immigrants will be pointed as responsible for all the evils in the developed countries.;N
Wars, climate change and increasing poverty will intensify immigration adding more fuel to the xenophobic movement.;N
Ideas such as Universal Basic Income and Universal Basic Assets will not gain strength and will not be applied in most countries.;N
This will only worsen the situation of the portion of society unable to find a job, which will be left to starve.;N
Part of this “extremely poor class” will not accept their situation in the economy, creating a security problem for governments as crimes rates increase.;N
Machines will have a strong role in imposing rules on the population.;N
Given the great social inequality, laws and security will be realized through machines.;N

LIKELY SCENAR PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 considering the benefits provided by automation, the government will keep an eye on the unemployment rates in order to keep it controlled while promoting economic growth.;N
The balance between automation and society demands is the key point to establish a virtuous circle in the automation expansion.;N
 services and products at the same time, a po lose their jobs, being fo ones even if not prepar and governments will measures to reduce automation to society a the economy.;N
 Governments will promote regulatory policies, in order to control the balance of the advancement in industry automation without locking it up and avoid the side effect of mass unemployment (or at least contain its fast growth).;N
Such policies will aim at protecting vulnerable people who will not be ready for this transformation.;N
In a first moment, only jobs that involve a high creativity load will remain unaffected because of the lack of technology to emulate this behavior on AI.;N
Governments and institutions will be able to contain this effect by investment and strengthening of education, with the aim of teaching new jobs in areas that will emerge.;N
Thus, governance institutions will be able to play a key role in this scenario as mediators between technology advances and people needs.;N
 Computerization reduction of low-skill Most of these p unemployment and stimulated to reduce th training their workers complete automation government will prov income.;N
This smoother fewer damages to soc keep consuming and th stable.;N
 Technologies such as IoT will continue to grow along with its demand.;N
The Communication globally as easier ac extensions and wirele cheapen the access t countries.;N
There will be between internation markets.;N
More people i will be able to work by quality of outsourcing and the prices will be A VIEW OF The government, motivated by the risk of reduction of the consumer market, will promote the flexibility of working hours, increasing the employment rate and the economic growth.;N
The medium and lowskilled workers that keep their jobs will face a reduction from the traditional 40 hours to 32 hours per week, gaining more time to use as desired.;N
This change will reduce the salaries.;N
To high-skilled workers, the flexibility will be an option considering that they will be a scarce workforce and the wage will be open to negotiation.;N
After a period of job insecurity and a series of disputes between Non-Standard forms of Employment (NSE) workers and their employees, the new types of work contracts will be better regulated in order to provide minimum rights.;N
These changes on regulation tend to improve the quality of services and reduce the conflicts between employers and employees on this job category Considering the new forms of employment, workers will not necessarily be associated to traditional trade unions as the ones we know.;N
It will take some time for these movements to be recognized by employers and by governments, but as soon as it happens, this movement will with current meth happens today, on progressively assum in this future new s Such progress in the labor market be deeper in kno adaptation to kn which are the stron again, governments helping and align th needed skills.;N
Add of education meth automation will m workload to the wo time to study and them updated opportunities in eac in the future, as learning.;N
Thus, a population will be needs of the new r the educational te not reach everybod of workers margina more qualified.;N
 Another impo influence of freedo versatility provided self-employment.;N
In PART 2: A VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 power to resist change, legislative power (policy makers) will be the most impacted.;N
The most radical groups will polarize the discussions in the political arena.;N
This phenomenon is a consequence of the greater dissemination of their ideas and convictions.;N
Moderates, in contrast, will be attacked from both sides and, thus, losing part of their representativeness.;N
Besides, minorities will also be able to join forces and empower themselves to confront social issues.;N
Broad dissemination of information and education will play important roles in promoting the protection of fundamental rights.;N
The role of the government will be to promote discussions on the platforms and to provide citizens with the most impartial information as possible, so that digital democracy can be put into practice.;N
In addition, it must execute, with the support and popular participation, the winning proposals.;N
With greater participation of the population in decisions, governments tend to increase the regulation of corporate actions, thus reducing the political power that large corporations have in the political arena.;N
 Another importan reduction of social in distribution of incom increased taxation t taxation in large corpo fortunes of the peopl received by the heirs, distribute wealth to society, promoting a b most vulnerable.;N
Bec impact on society, t Income should not rea and inequalities will con 9.5.;N
ECONOMY In this scenario, c China, India, Indones likely to grow their GDP to four percent per Indonesia are likely larger than the United while Pakistan and Eg Italy and Canada on Parity (PPP) basis.;N
In t year, Vietnam, India an the fastest growing eco 2050.;N
 GDP will not be t measure how fast a co itself – others indexes A VIEW OF this role.;N
The definition of new ways of working, basic income and new public policies will be decisive tasks to the government.;N
Countries that are prepared to it will succeed, the rest of them must learn how to deal with it.;N
There is not a recipe.;N
For that reason, the rules related to create new ways of employment and diversities of public policies does not apply to all countries.;N
Governments have to find ways to reinvent themselves, adapting to their specificities and building their own public policies, possible mitigating the automation effects.;N
In addition, free market may also help society.;N
There will be other ways to organize production.;N
Alternative, sharing, social, green and creative economy will become more popular.;N
Social banks will be important allies for that process.;N
They can finance these initiatives, so that is important to create new jobs, moving economy and mitigating poverty.;N
Although a worldwide-growth scenario is positive, this scenario is the one that slow down the inequality increase.;N
Inequality may be considered the gap between the richest people and the poorest people.;N
In the future, government will have an important role in this discussion.;N
It is the second, people liv migrating to urban the developed, and world will be ur shows some negat urbanization may c of cities, health ha water pollution and other hand, urb expenses on tran create cultural dive Cities will b connected.;N
