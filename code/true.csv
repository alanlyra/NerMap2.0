The vision was spelled out as: ED M A ` By 2030, there are comprehensive international IT security standards in place that enable decentralized, global and highly secure production networks. 
After the two expert inputs followed a facilitated discussion and brainstorming on questions such as ` What are characteristics of secure Industry 4.0 value creation networks or ` Which requirements do they meet regarding systems, companies, people ? Clustering the brainstorming results of the two tables on security for example led to four key areas that built the pillars for a joint vision on an ideal state in 2030: legal framework/standards, characteristics of future production networks, transnational and intersectoral cooperation as well as social requirements. 
AI and related technologies will drive innovation and economic growth creating 133 million new jobs globally by 2022 and contributing to 20% of GDP in China alone by 2030 .
